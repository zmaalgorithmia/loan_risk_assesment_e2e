I have already saved $5,000 in an attempt to meet the SBA requirements of 20% collateral of the SBA.

We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.

The fourteen months since that wonderful weekend have been, if nothing else, an adventure.

What I meant to say was I would rather pay a fixed interest rate of 10% on just one loan rather than pay a variable interest on 3 credit cards. Which each credit card is at least 18% interest.

I tried consolidation groups since 2000.  I had a credit outstanding of over 42,000.00 on two cards at that time.  I am now down to 6300.00 remaining but I dropped out the consolidation group because I would pay my money and the banks and consolidation group would hold my money as long as they could jacking up my interest.  It was bad.  So lfe goes on and I rack up other bills trying to get rid of the bills I have had.  Vicious circle and I just want one bill so I can have peace of mind and sleep again.  My life is a mess right now and only I can fix it with of course the help you your lenders.  Please help me.  The banks certainly don't. Does it matter if I fix my spelling errors.  I type for a living, too. My ultimate goal of buying a home will not be immediate, but right now it's not even within reach.

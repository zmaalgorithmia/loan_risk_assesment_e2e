No,M0709516,Fully Paid,Mayo Clinic,3 years,RENT,58100,n,"Good afternoon everyone.  I greatly appreciate your assistance in getting this funded.  I am a 28 y/o professional that helps Drs. at a world Famous hospital in Minnesota get funding for research to help patients.  I love having the opportunity to make the lives of cancer patients better, and help develop new techniques for radiation oncology.  It is incredibly stressful, but also reqarding. Life hit a speed bump when I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety earlier this year, and then got worse when my wife decided that she was going to divorce me.  Because of the divorce my wife has kind of taken control, and I pretty much only see my adorable 15 month old daughter every other Saturday.  (I'm tearing up just thinking about it.)  My plan with this money is to assist me with divorce attorney fees because my family has never had money like her family has.  I also want to purchase a cruiser motorcycle that I can use for the occasional trips to visit my daughter where my soon to be ex leaves the house and I spend time with my little girl there.  I think this will really save on gas money.  Also, I just think that riding on the open road (helmet for me of course), would be a great stress reliever.  I really just need to feel less stress..., feel happy, and feel normal again.  Thank you for all of you that look at this and help.  I could really use this for so many reasons right now.  I hope it will happen.  Thank you all in advance.  You have no idea how much it means to me.  Sincerely, Seth B. Thank everyone so much.  If  I am fortunate enough to obtain this loan, it will be used for a bike.  It will also be used to pay off some higher interest credit cards, and medical bills that I was left with as the result of a recent divorce.  Thank you all so much in advance.  I hope this is able to come through soon.  Best Regards. Thank you all so much.  I am just finishing going through a divorce, and this will help with medical bills I was left with so that they can be paid and the hospital won't try to be collecting from me.  Also, I was left with a higher interest card with a balance and this would help take care of that.  Also, I have been through a great deal since before last November (depression, illness, injury, divorce...and now I am only currently able to see my 15 month old daughter every other Saturday, and that's usually not even spending the night...) I have always wanted a bike (non-sports/rocket) in order to get some open air (helmet of course), and just try to be a little bit happier since it has been so long since I have.  I appreciate all of your help.  Thank you, and best regards. Thank you everyone that has helped so far.  I really appreciate it.  I just wanted to let it be known that I will have additional medical expenses for myself that would also need to be covered by this.  This will help with costs, and fees that the hospital would normally add on, but will then take away from the &quot;stress relief&quot;/'fun money&quot;.  (It is more important for me to get bills taken care of than to purchase a bike as a post divorce stress-reliever, even though I think it would have assisted me with some other issues I am currently dealing with.  Once again I appreciate all of your help and consideration.  It means so much to me. Best Regards. Thank you all so much so far.  I hope this can help me move on a bit faster.  The process has went quickly so far.  I really hope this can be funded.  It's so close. Thank you and best regards. Thank you all.  I hope my answers and details have helped.

I'm definitely doing a paverstone covered patio and some serious landscaping.  A moderate   fountain/pond is in the plans, as well.   I'm a good borrower because the trend of my life over the past five years would indicate such.  Five years ago, my credit   score was very poor.  It's currently plenty good enough for my listing to be accepted.  I've worked very hard since a short   tenure of financial ignorance to establish my creditworthiness.  I keep track of every dollar.

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are ""above and beyond"" the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such ""above and beyond"" circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).  My own credit rating is reputable enough, as you can see, and I've never made a late payment.

I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan.

I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).

(Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: 1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years 2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) 3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom 4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.

No,M0450523,Fully Paid,Stanford University School of Medicine,< 1 year,RENT,29950,n,"Hello. My name is Roberto and I am currently a 24-year old medical student at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I am a kind and smart guy that is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon.  In the past (2006) I used Prosper to borrow money to fix up my 1971 Chevrolet Nova Muscle Car and was very pleased with the experience.  I borrowed $3,000 and paid it off in 12 months.  I am now seeking $10,750 to invest in U.S. equities and will be paying off my loan in 36 months.  I am an extremely hard working guy that was top of my class in college.  I am a very low risk borrower as I have NEVER been late on a credit card payment or peer-to-peer lending payment.  I have a lot going for me and will not risk messing up my credit or reputation by being late on any payments to a lender.  I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at http://www.pdsoros.org/current_fellows/   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over $23,000 in cash, all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around $30,000, owe $8000 on my credit cards (that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of $2500/month, I only use $1700 of it, does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score), go to medical school on a near full-ride, and have positive cash flow exceeding $800/month after all my expenses are taken into account.  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor.  Her income will cover groceries, gas, and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over $1100/month starting this fall. I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer.  You may ask why I have $8,000 in credit card debt when I have $23,000 in cash and $30,000 in assets?  That is because I have a 0% APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now.  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring, we have paid for the honeymoon, and our parents are paying for the wedding. I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0% APR deal ends I will pay the cards off.  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this $10,750 loan.   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities.  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing. This enormous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression, has left good companies (in infrastructure, tech, agriculture, shipping) trading at a fraction of what they were.  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every U.S. economic crisis in history.  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of $10,000 and turned it into $20,000 through learning to manage risk with stops, investing on a mixture of momentum, news, technical analysis, and fundamentals, not letting emotion, greed, or fear make me hold losing positions, learning to sell my losses and ride my gains, etc.  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 (2004 BMW 330Ci).  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon (next couple years) has once again convinced me to start to move some money ($5,000) back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already.  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan.",930xx,CA,14.98,0,1/1/00,0,NA,NA,9,0,77.2,14,FALSE,0,NA,77%,1,T

Thankfully, I was able to pick up more hours at job #2 to cover bills, etc, but now I have to pay health insurance on my own since I am not full time at either job.  I have recently had a medical emergency, and accrued a little credit card debt trying to cover my regular monthly bills, health insurance, &amp; unexpected medical bills.  I'm doing all I can, and have been doing great so far juggling this all alone, but I need to pay off the only credit card I have before it gets me in too deep.  I have moved in with my boyfriend who is not asking for a dime towards rent, utilities, or groceries so that I can put all my money and efforts towards getting these debts paid off quicker than ever.  It would be such a great relief and help to be able to do this!   I am and have always been a very responsible person financially, and know that with my dependable income (although coming from two separate places), it is within my budget to pay this loan off with no problem whatsoever.

I bought a house under my parents' name and needed to make a substantial down-payment by using cash advances. Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job.   Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:  I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.  The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.  As for my monthly budget:  Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util.  Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan Transportation: $100 Food/Misc.: $300  I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions.

Networks,5 years,RENT,53307,n,"Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan.

A place thriving of independent film makers, production companies, and film studios.  I currently am employed at a job that I have been at for 3 years now.   I am still in the development stages of my business, I have invested 10K of my money from my current job to help build the business (i.e. permit, registrations, equipment, storage)  This is a new business venture for me that I am seeking,  I see the potential in generating a great profit by providing the lowest price's on equipment rental's to draw in customers, and also I have 3 years experience as an Independent film maker as well so I know exactly what products are in high demand, and what products are not.  I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am very familiar with what equipment customers are in high demand of, and 2, I can produce the lowest rates on rentals to attract new customers to my business.  At my current job, I work evenings, so I plan to work both until my business takes off and shows signs of stability (i.e. 12 months of generating profitable income)  With a 10K loan, I will be able to purchase the sufficient ammount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.

With the recession knocking a lot of businesses out, I see this as a great time during our rebuilding phase to get my business to take off. Films are still being made, shows are still running, and there are countless potential customers in independent film makers looking to film their ideas.

Though we live away from Indiana, we have our own team set up locally in Indianapolis, consisting of a general contractor, a construction mgmt company, a realtor, a home inspector, and a property management company.

The renovation was a big success and ended before the scheduled end date, thanks to the very talented team.  Upon securing our second rental property, we will be using the same team to renovate it, lease it out, and collect rents.  Monthly rents from the 2nd rental property will be covering our monthly payments to you (Lendingclub lenders).  It would take a month or two before the property becomes move-in ready and gets rented out.  This will most likely result in a situation where we have to pay you before we collect any rent from our tenant.  So, what do we do if we have to pay you before collecting the first rent???

I WAS AMAZED AT THE REPSONSES (THANK YOU) SO I AM GOING TO REQUEST WHAT I REALLY NEED TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ON THIS DEAL. I went into business with family. I was 50% co-owner of a truckstop. We built it in 2007. For the first year and a half, my partners stood back and let me run it. I made over $300K with it in 2008. In early 2009, they decided to participate and it went down hill fast. To make a long story short, it went under in Nov. 2009. The landlord, our fuel supplier (Amaroil.com), evicted our company for past due fuel invoice debt. The landlord wishes to re-lease the site to me (because I made us money when I was alone) and understandably wants me to obtain my own working capital to re-enter the business. I cannot qualify for any conventional lending because I have no collateral. Everything I have is tied up in my business. I have one past 30 day hit on my credit record my entire life. All three of my Fico's are over 700. I am married with a 2 year old, I like to hunt and fish in my off time. I have been married for 5 years, and my wife works side by side with me in the business.  Your money will be paid back. Your money will go to good use (working capital). I pay and treat my employees very well, and alot of people are depending on me to get this thing back going. If interested, I can give you the google earth location to see the site for yourself.  Thanks for any consideration.  Craig I wanted to add: Anyone who is a small business operator now days guards their credit with their life. If you dont have a ton of cash or collateral, your credit is all you have. Right now, all I have is my credit, and it took me over 10 years to get it where it is. I will guard it with my life. Even 1 over 30 day late payment is unacceptable as a business owner. Your money will bring you a return. I just noticed I am last on this entire list of listing.. :)  My three Ficos are over 750... I guess it is the multiple inquires.  I have alot of inquiries that are business vendor related.. Before coke, pepsi, bud, etc will haul $5000+ into your store a week on credit, they check your credit.  Some vendors check you 2 to 3 times a year..FYI. I noticed someone invested a rather substantial amount in our request.  I want to humbly say thank you.

This loan is being used to pay for my son's wedding and wedding gift---he recently completed an 18-month tour in Iraq, and we couldn't be more elated and relieved that he is finally back home, safe. It will not be the most elaborate wedding, as we are staying budget conscious, but it will hopefully be a beautiful little event that they will always remember.  I was turned on to LC after being directed here by LendingTree. I applied in two places; a credit union, and LendingTree. I received approval from the credit union, and from both lenders that LendingTree (one being here at LC). I never knew of LC before, and after spending several hours researching exactly what it is, reading reviews, and scouring the fine print of the loan agreements/borrower membership agreement, I can't believe I didn't stumble across this earlier.  I decided to go with a personal loan through LC for two reasons; 1) Although I have the available credit lines on my cards, the lowest interest rate right now is around the 15 to 16 percent range, which is nearly triple the LC rate I qualified for, and 2) The entire idea of giving money back to the hardworking people who deserve it, and are kind enough to lend it to others, is just so much better than giving it to the &quot;big boys&quot; that have left me so disgusted these past few years. I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.   I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years. I am very fiscally responsible, as you can see by the &quot;A3&quot; loan grade, and I have been working in the financial sector for over 25 years. I can't think of much else to add, but I do appreciate you taking the time to read through this and sincerely hope I can get fully funded so that the interest goes back to the P2P lending network rather than the big boys on wall street.

No,M1231479,Fully Paid,JPMorgan Chase Bank,7 years,RENT,48000,n,"The reason that I described my loan as a life changing one is because over the last 5 years or so I have made a determined effort to change my life from one that was lazy and not really moving anywhere, to one that takes pride in financial well-being and is moving towards a successful future.  And this loan will be an important key in the success of my life changing goals.  I plan to use these funds to pay down credit card debt, student loan debt and I am also thinking about using a small portion for something very personal that will change my life forever.  I know I am going to be a great borrower due to the fact that, as I have stated, I take great pride in my financial well-being.  Also, I work for a bank in a department that deals with helping homeowners.  This experience has without a doubt opened my eyes to what can happen when money and budgets are not managed correctly and/or logically, therefore I know what it truly means to be a good borrower to any financial institution that lends money.  My Monthly budget is a simple one, most of my debt is from a couple of credit cards, 1 installment loan, student loans and my rent, which is not a lot because I have 2 roommates and that helps to keep the living expenses down considerably.  I have a car that is completely paid off and is in great condition.  I would be more than happy to answer any questions regarding my monthly budget if more detail is required.  As I have stated I am employed at a Bank, and I feel that after 7 years of working at the bank, I know I have a very stable job.  I was just recently promoted to a much more important role, and this promotion is more proof of how stable my job is and also demonstrates a little more of how I will be a good borrower.  I would like to say Thank You for this opportunity that has been provided by Lending Club, I truly think this is a great business and am looking forward to being a part of it.",146xx,NY,13.1,0,12/1/99,0,31,NA,11,0,37.6,17,FALSE,0,NA,38%,1,T

I always make payments on time, and usually pay more than the minimum, because I don't really like being in debt. Also, the job info. on this site won't really give a good idea of how much I actually make. I recently (January of this year) got a job with the state of CT. In order to accomodate the schedule for it, I dropped myself down to on-call status with my other employer Sunrise Northeast, for whom I've worked for over 5 years. I take extra hours as a I please with both jobs, and therefore make 2-3 times my base pay, which is only about 1200 per month, pretax. Since I am able to take on more time, within certain limits of course, I can work more to pay for extras such as vacation, without sacrificing paying my bills. I believe that I am a good candidate because of the aforementioned, and hope that you will view me as such.  Thank you for your time, and I hope that I am approved.",062xx,CT,10.84,0,4/1/02,1,45,NA,14,0,56.6,15,FALSE,0,NA,57%,1,T

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).",177xx,PA,13.45,0,10/1/96,0,NA,NA,7,0,7.4,23,FALSE,0,NA,7%,1,T

Prior to turning 17 I worked part time from the age of 13.  I held my first real job at a Market Research firm for 10 years.  I worked my way up from telemarketer to Marketing Director eventually landing in Honolulu HI running a branch office.  When that office closed, I went to work for Nextel Communications and was a Customer Relations Manager for about 2 years before moving to CA.  Since living in CA I have had 2 jobs, the first as Operations Manager for an IT Outsourcing company (2 years) and most recently as a Data Analyst with a Telecom Expense Management firm where I have been employed for the past 2.5 years.  There are no gaps in my employment history and I have never been without a job.   I currently have 8 debtors, which includes 7 credit cards at decent interest rates and a small line of credit for overdraft protection.  I have paid off a home mortgage, and 6-8 auto loans with no late payments or fees.  I have never bounced a check, missed a payment, or had any liens against me.  The only issue with my credit report is the credit cards for which I am seeking this loan to pay off, all of which are up to date and in good standing.  My take home pay is about $3K a month.  I have monthly expenses of about $1815($800 rent, $200 car payment, $65 insurance, $150 utilities, currently paying $600+ on credit cards).  My goal is to pay off my credit cards and close all but one of them with this loan.  The remaining credit card I plan on making $150 payments on until paid off.  I would like to purchase another home in 4-5 years once this debt is paid up.  I do have access to family funds and a second income from my partner in the event of any emergencies.  I also have $6K in savings to fall back on.  I am very proud of my credit and payment history and would never do anything to damage my credit.  The majority of this credit card debt was accrued 10+ years ago and I am currently living well within my means.  My problem is that since I have such a large amount of credit card debt banks will not issue me a consolidation loan despite my flawless payment history.

(Side note: NO Student Loans! thanks to my wonderful parents). I've since grown financially wise and level, but the past is haunting me, and I want this debt GONE ASAP. It's time to erase it for good. I'm sick of the rude credit card companies and interest rates that keep slowly creeping up. I am looking for $20,000 to combine and erase a ~$15,000 balance, ~$4000 balance, and ~$1000 balance on 3 different accounts. The loan WILL be paid back in 3 years or very likely less. Join me in the fight. Thanks everyone for all your assistance! Quick update.... I was initially a little disappointed with my loan grade I got. I had a 730 according to Equifax earlier this summer last I looked. So I pulled another credit report just to check. Turns on I am still an &quot;authorized user&quot; on my parent's Bank of America credit card. It had been dormant and $0 for a couple years, but my dad just very recently transferred $10k+ to because of a good interest rate, and it popped up on my credit. Yuck. He's working on removing me as a user ASAP, but for the time being, my current revolving credit balance is a little higher than my true debt.

No,M1062603,Fully Paid,J. W. Legacy,1 year,RENT,35000,n,"Outdoor lifestyle apparel is a rapidly growing segment of the retail industry. Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.  Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.  Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.  I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner.

I had worked for Dimension One as a Construction Superintendent for 5 years and was laid off in 2/09 due to the slowing of specialty retail construction.  During my 5 years with Dimension One I experienced growth and had been promoted to manage very large scale projects.  I was one of the last of 3 on the team to be laid off when the last projects had been put on hold.  I had not planned or been prepared for the 10 months of unemployment that followed. Since being hired by Corix in 12/09, I have been working to pay off debt as well as add back to savings. This loan would allow for me to do this more quickly.  I am a dedicated employee and I have been recognized as such by both Corix Utilities and IBEW Local 47 since I was hired.  I continue to be amoung the top performers Corix has in the field based on monthly reviews.  I pick up all over time shifts they offer to the team (this often means 6 shifts a week of 10 hrs each) and I will continue to do so as they are made available to me.  I am committed, driven, dependable and not afraid of good old fashion hard work!  I am happy to have the opportunity when many people are still struggling.",908xx,CA,16.76,0,8/1/95,0,28,NA,8,0,59.1,8,FALSE,0,NA,59%,1,T

In four months time, from the time they took over the account from Washington Mutual, they raised my percentage rate twice, forced me to make two payments in one month, charged me a late fee and then reduced my credit limit, which was the final straw for me. The remaining amount of the loan will be placed into my savings account as part of my emergency fund. My significant other of 11 years lost his job a year ago in a reorganization.  He was fortunate to find another job, but for less pay.  Due to the economy, there is less work and the company has cut back on hours.

No,M0296181,Fully Paid,"Cain Brothers & Co., LLC",1 year,MORTGAGE,95000,n,"Help me take the last steps out of financial hardship, and into becoming a lender.  Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location ‰ÛÒ walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan ‰ÛÒ I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value ‰ÛÒ I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

My gross margins are around 50% and profit margins hover around 25% to 30% per month.  Even at 14.59% annually, my business can easily cover the loan payment.  I would like to start with a smaller loan, establish a payment history, and slowly build out bigger lines of credit through the community here.

My job is to structure the sale of asset-backed securities;  so rest assured I work in the institutional lending game every day.

A little about my history is that I do not have the best credit rating due to where my husband and I were at several years ago. About 5 years ago I was still moving up in the company I work for. My husband was laid off in his job with an adverstising firm. We had a lot of school loans, credit card debt, etc. When we were younger we did not make the best decisions on purchases and spending. Like a lot of young people, we had lots of credit card debt and were in over our heads. We could make payments on the credit cards when we were both working, though we were not making a lot of headway in paying them down. Then when my husband lost his job we took on more debt just to stay afloat. We missed a lot of payments. Over the last 5 years I have moved up in my job and now make around $90,000 a year. My husband makes between $55,000 and $75,000, depending on the amount of overtime he gets during the year. In the last few years my husband and I have dug ourselves out of over $80,000 in debt. All we have now is a house payment at $1,100/15 years, his truck payment $360/month 2 1/2 years remaining, and an old personal loan $157/month &ndash; matures 2014 at 8%. It has just been in this last year that we finally got to this point. Then this happens. I don&rsquo;t have the $12,000+ saved up to fix the small flood in my front yard. (I asked for $14,000 as I will have to have my walk path re-poured and don&rsquo;t know exactly how much that will cost.) I really can&rsquo;t wait another 6-8 months to save the money to get this fixed. I really need to get it fixed in the next few weeks before it gets really bad. I can&rsquo;t tell you how badly I do not want to take on this loan. I don&rsquo;t want to be back in debt but do not have a choice. We have checked with several banks and they will lend us the money, since we have such great income. But because of all of the past debt we had where we were late on our payments (when my husband had no job and I was only making around $35,000 a year) they want to loan it to us at 23-25%. If that is my only choice I will have to accept it. But, my husband encouraged me to give it a few days and try this site since the interest rate is lower. I am very nervous about getting a loan in this manner but he says &ldquo;have faith&rdquo; and see what this brings. So here I am, having faith, and asking for people to take a chance and invest in me.",350xx,AL,2.55,1,12/1/93,1,18,NA,10,0,1.5,28,FALSE,0,NA,2%,1,T

If we are blessed to obtain full funding we will do a few more things that need getting done.  We have used Lending Club before to borrow and have never missed a payment over the last 2 years.  I did some calculating and found that after paying off the remainder of the first loan with Lending Club and paying off a couple high interest cards that we will actually lower our monthly payments for debt.  Having this loan will drop our payments by a couple hundred dollars per month which is definitely advantageous.

To say it was very rewarding for the entire family is not doing it justice. The second event occurred just months later. I was involved in a car accident and was out of work for 6 months. The third event occurred 1 yr after the accident. I had to have both knees replaced, nothing to do with the car accident, again loosing 5 to 6 months of work because of complications 6 weeks into recoup. During the second two events I found myself using the credit cards to pay the co-pay for medicine and Dr. visits, food and gas. I was able to pay the minimum each month but then the interest on the cards started to edge up one after the other, I found myself swimming against the tide.

No,M0697640,Fully Paid,Oracle,4 years,MORTGAGE,102000,n,"Hello!  Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan! I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents. I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt. Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up. If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip. All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.",941xx,CA,16.8,0,12/1/90,0,NA,NA,9,0,89.3,22,FALSE,0,NA,89%,1,T

I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.  Lindsey co-directs GoGoVertigoat Dance Project (www.gogovertigoat.org).

This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.  My sister is determined to keep her career which she has worked so hard to build and I am doing what I can to help her.

Yes,M0643705,Charged Off,Nome Public Schools,5 years,MORTGAGE,64000,n,"I have a degenerative eye condition called keratakonis.  It has worsened to a point that my eyes can no longer be fitted with glasses or contacs.  my only option is to have a corneal cross-linking done to stabilize the cornea, then either a lens implant or lens transplant to allow my eyes to be fitted properly.  If I do not have the procedure, then I am faced with the inconvenience of not being able to see clearly and place my career of choice for over 20 years on the line.  As a teacher, I am continuously transitioning from close vision to far away and the keratakonis keeps me from having that clarity. Unfortunately, this medical procedure is quite expensive and not covered by insurance.  Also, due to my home location, travel and lodging for re-coup time and follow up appointments almost double the cost of the operation.  I do not have that kind of expendable cash, thus am asking for assistance.  Any money received that is not needed for my surgery will be used to pay other eye doctor appointment costs that were out-of-pocket for consultation, etc. Thank you so much for any  and all assistance you can provide.  I am a good risk, pay my bills on time and have secure employment with tenure.  Have a wonderful day!  strandisa  :) I would like to add that I also pick up extra jobs that I use to supplement general daily living expenses and at times I have needed to put that money towards bills if I happened to have a short month.  I tutor students privately outside of school for $40 dollars per hour, rent out a room when short-term visitors come to Nome on a special occasion or assignment, and I did have a roommate for three years, but she recently moved out, thus the main reason why my debt increased.  I just wanted to point out that although the budget I submitted appears very tight on paper, there are always options for me to utilize in helping financially, thus there's actually a god amount of ""wiggle"" room.  thank you!!  Have a super day!!  strandisa33  : ) Dear investors...thank you soooo much for your contribution to making my loan successful.  I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a ""pay it forward"" philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.  Anyway...I have no words that go deep enough to express how much I appreciate your generosity.  I promise you that you will not be sorry and will be paid in full as soon as I am able.  God bless you!!  Fondly,  Susan  ;) null",997xx,AK,15.31,0,2/1/97,0,27,NA,7,0,80.4,24,FALSE,0,NA,80%,1,T

No,M0713497,Fully Paid,CustomeNews,9 years,MORTGAGE,100000,n,"Our reason for applying for this loan is two-fold: help us significantly pay down credit card debt we have accumulated and struggled paying due to unforeseen expenses, including emergency gallbladder surgery, costly automobile repairs (needed so we can get to work) and my fiance being unemployed for 5 months - he chose not to move back home when his temporary assignment from his long-time employer ended in order to remain in my area and propose to me.  I have been in the Maryland area for 9 years, and will mark my 9 year anniversay at my employer, a small publishing company, in October. My responsibilities continue to grow as I bring in new accounts and expand our offerings. My fiance secured a job in management at a sporting goods store with a national retail company in February, and is eager to make a name for himself here. We are both hardworkers and come from similar backgrounds that stress that.  I bought my condo 3 1/2 years ago - and the housing market as taken a hit. We plan to live here for at least two to three more years to be able to be in a better position with the mortgage. Due to the market drop, a home equity loan is not an option.  We feel we are a good borrower because we have recognized the mistakes we made, and are not happy that we put ourselves in this position. We have been trying for the past few months to get a handle on our debt, but feel we can best do this with a personal loan that can help us better manage our payments, and eventually put us in a position to start saving. Not that we were not before, but are now moreso very careful with our money.  This loan will be used to help us pay off a good number of our credit cards, as well as pay the remaining balance due on our wedding. If we knew now what we knew last summer, maybe we would have approached our wedding differently. But hindsight is 20-20, so now we are just trying to get our finances on the right track.  We know that the monthly payment we take on, if our loan is fully funded, will represent 12% of our monthly income -- and this would help put us in a much better position that we stand right now. We appreciate the investments to date. Lending Club will receive the documents for my employment verification in a few hours --  I was unable to send on Wednesday due to being out of town.

I am a straight forward person and would like to explain my loan request.  I am looking to consolidate lines of credit, credit cards, etc...  My mother is ill and is on a transplant list. I  have taken out some loans to help my mother and ease some of her financial burden. Along with my own debt, it has been a bit overwhelming, but I  I have an excellent job, lots of motivation and determination.  I have ways to pay off debt, where she does not.  The 16000.00 would be used for this and only this.  I am not wanting anything other than just to manage things a bit easier and relieve some of the daily stress that I have.  I am a trustworthy person and would like someone to take a chance on me.  I know that my credit is not perfect, but my scores have been getting higher and I have been working hard for the past few years to make a difference on my credit report.  I have a request like many others, I am sure. My credit may come across to some as a high risk, but I can assure you that I am not.  I take my debts seriously and take responsibility for them. I have helped more than I should at times, but that is who I am.  I am confident in myself and want you to be as well.  Thank you for your consideration! This loan is very secure for the lender.  I have a very stable job and take pride in my work ethics.  I am simply trying to pay down my debt, increase my credit score, and manage my debts as simple as possible.  I am not a risk and have worked hard over the ast few years to really understand how to increase your credit and be considered a good candidate when applying for loans.  I would be thankful to the person or persons who fund my loan.  I am hoping to close this as soon as possible.  I want to change my current situation.  I would like one line vs. 6 or more.  I am making a difference not only for me but my faimly.  I would also be interested in doing future business with a lender that is willing to take a chance on me now.  I am true to my word and have many goals past the one I am trying to accomplish right now.  Again, thank you for your consideration. This is a whole new way to work with others to help each other- where both parties benefit.  I am hopeful that I will be a customer for many years to come.  Maybe someday for something a bit more exciting, but I am on my way! Here are the details of the debts I am looking to consolidate.  If I am fully funded I am going to get as many lines paid down as I can.  I usually pay more than the minimum and I would continue to do this on this one loan as well.   That would offset some of the higher interest being paid on some.  My overall payment would be lower and I would increase my credit score with the fewer number of lines and revolving credit.  I am not looking to continue to keep more than one cc. when pd off. I will close and pay off.  I believe I should let them report paid with a o balance and then start closing them.  I will seek advice on what it the best route.  I will not be using the cards at all.

While I was in the process of getting my mortgage, Congress changed the rules credit card companies follow, and as a result, they raised interest rates on virtually everyone, myself included. At the time, all of my credit cards except one went from having interest rates under 10% to having interest rates of over 20%.   I had the option to not accept the new, higher interest rates, close the credit cards and pay them off at the lower rates, and would have, but I was advised not to do so at the time, as it would have radically changed my credit picture and jeopardized the mortgage I was in the process of getting.  I will use this loan to pay off all of my credit card debt.  I am an excellent borrower as I have a spotless payment history with all of my lenders. I have never missed or even been late with a payment - ever - on anything.   I have an incredibly stable job, and I will have been with my current company for 7 years in January.  My car loan will be paid off in the next few months, which will lower my monthly expenses by almost the same amount as my monthly loan payment through Lending Club.

I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured.

No,M0674606,Fully Paid,LimitedBrands Corporation,10+ years,RENT,114773.98,n,"Dear potential investors,  The loan I am requesting will be used to consolidate my high interest credit accounts, moving expenses and assist with additional move-in related payments.  On the day this loan request was created (5/24) and as my screen name suggests, my FICO Score with TransUnion was 715.  My timely payments in excess of the minimum due each month have not been enough to keep my interest rates at a reasonable level.  While I have been consistently on time with my payments to Citibank, my interest rate has risen to 29.990%.  The majority of my monthly payments (approximately 80%) are now absorbed by high finance charges rather than paying off my actual balance.  I am a successful district manager for Limited Brands' Bath & Body Works division.  More than 1600 stores in the United States and we are expanding into Canada and have a few overseas locations.  I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt.  On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates.  I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment. Additional notes: I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.  I want to add an additional note to alleviate any potential concerns investors may have about my ability to repay the loan here on Lending Club.  In the unlikely event that I found myself unemployed and without a steady stream of income, I would borrow against my 401k retirement account to pay back my loan here on Lending Club.  As of today (5-28) I have $90,000 between my 401k/savings retirement account.

The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).  2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.  3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!  I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

To have just one payment to to lending club would be more efficient and also increase my credit score I want to streamline my finances.  The best way is to first eliminate the credit card debt.  From there, it will be very easy to practically manage my finances.  Ultimately, my goal is to eliminate all debt and be able to concentrate solely on investment and increased savings for my retirement. I have very good credit.  It is 712 across all three credit bureaus.  In the 3+ years that I have had a monthly credit monitoring subscription,  I have never been late with any payments.  This includes car loan/insurance, mortgage payments, home utility payments and credit card bills.  My monthly budget is approximately 2500.00, with a net pay of 3300.00 per month.  With the high interest rates,  I want to eliminate all credit card debt and loan payments.  That way I can concentrate on repaying just my Lending Club bill each month, my mortgage, and utilities.  I have been employed by the largest non-profit hospital health system in North Central PA for 4+ years as a Professional Allied Health Professional.  My job is extremely secure;  we are expanding with Providers Offices/Clinics in the SE PA regions of Allentown PA, Philadelphia PA, and South Jersey.  I have no fear of layoffs, which is a blessing in today's economy.  If anything, our HR division is adding jobs to the Health Sysytem everyday.  One last thing about my employer,  President Obama lauded our health system as a role model for Excellence in Healthcare while keeping costs down. I really want to eliminate the variable rates of my credit cards.  I now believe that credit cards are not the way to buy products.  I have changed to paying cash for goods. What makes your investment/loan secure is that I am an extremely reliable person.  My credit score is very good; I have never been late with my car loan/insurance, credit card payments, loan payments, or any of my household utility bills.  I have a very secure job as a Medical Technologist at a Major Healthcare System of note, and I have been continuously employed there for 4+ years.  My monthly bills TOTAL approximately 2500.00 and my net income is approximately 3500.00 per month.  My fiance has been out of work since December of last year, so I have paid all of my bills.

Right now many of my accounts have very high interest rates, various nickel and dime fees which frustrate me, annual fees, and I want to be debt-free within the next 5 years or so. Unfortunately I had to use my credit cards about 5 years ago when I was laid off by my previous employer who told me it was temporary and to just wait a week. That week turned into 4 months before I realized my cards were getting maxed out and took a different job. Since then I have not made as much progress paying down my debt as I would like. While I have made some progress, it's not enough, I want to be debt free in 5 years.    I recently purchased a house and rent out several of the rooms to help with my income. I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).    My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:  Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)  Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)  Citi: $2100 (29.99%)  Sears: $2300 (28.99%)  Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)  Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)  Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)  HSBC: 300 (29.99%)    I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.    I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much.

I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.    If you have any questions, please let me know. Borrower added on 06/21/11 > I would like to add that my FICO score is quite low, but only because I recently changed from a big bank to a small credit union.  I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.

No,M0390370,Fully Paid,24 Hour Fitness,< 1 year,RENT,20000,n,"My name is Chris and I live in Austin, Texas.  IÌ¢åÛåªm currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job IÌ¢åÛåªve done since last December after getting out of school.  IÌ¢åÛåªm a hard worker, and IÌ¢åÛåªm usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, IÌ¢åÛåªve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that IÌ¢åÛåªve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, IÌ¢åÛåªve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I donÌ¢åÛåªt have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that IÌ¢åÛåªm not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, IÌ¢åÛåªve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, IÌ¢åÛåªll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when IÌ¢åÛåªm asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  IÌ¢åÛåªm not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until IÌ¢åÛåªm in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, IÌ¢åÛåªm willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave RamseyÌ¢åÛåªs Financial Peace University course.  In case youÌ¢åÛåªre not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where Ì¢åÛåÏevery dollar is spent before the month begins.Ì¢åÛå  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.  Thanks for reading, and I look forward to working with you.",787xx,TX,10.32,0,6/1/05,1,NA,NA,4,0,97.1,6,FALSE,0,NA,97%,1,T

Credit Card 1: $13,500.00 Credit Card 2: $11,300.00 Credit Card 3: $3,000.00 Credit Card 4: $7,000.00 (joint account)  I plan to payoff Credit Card 1 with this loan (it's the highest interest rate out of all my cards).  The rest of my credit card debts were accumulated through the purchase of goods to be sold on ebay.  I plan to payoff a major part of this debt, if not all of it, within the next 6 months as I start liquidating my inventory.  As for my savings of 16-20%, this is accumulated by me maxing out my 401k contributions at work.  Currently, the law lets me put a max amount of 16.5% and my employer matches 3%.  Depending on my other income during the month (bonus at work, ebay income), I either try to pay down my credit card debt or save what I am able to in an interest earning MMA.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks again for your consideration.",201xx,VA,11.72,0,10/1/97,0,NA,NA,13,0,68.9,31,FALSE,0,NA,69%,1,T

The fourteen months since that wonderful weekend have been, if nothing else, an adventure. We have since moved to Concord where he is getting a master's and doctorate in Music Therapy and working as a behavioral therapist with autistic children.

I have always made the payments on time and kept up other debt in the meanwhile. I had hoped to have the current loan paid off within the next six months. Unfortunately, due to matters beyond my control and which I am not at liberty to disclose, I was forced to take on additional debt over the course of the last six months. Now that the matter has been resolved, I can continue to pay off the existing loan and also pay down the new debt accrued at a fairly aggressive rate; however, I would prefer to secure a new loan for a slightly larger amount and longer term. My goal is to pay off the loan in 3 years or preferably less. With that said, I am requesting a five-year loan with the idea the unexpected can happen so having a lower monthly amount due to begin with will allow me to keep money in savings for the unknown and not have to rely on credit cards. I will also try to pay more than is due each month in order to pay off the loan as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Using this new loan I am committed to: paying off the existing Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months; pay off all outstanding credit card and personal loan debt, and leave myself with only this new monthly loan, a small auto loan, monthly rent and some associated bills, such as heating, etc.  I would be willing to agree to a loan of a lesser amount. However, for the sake of credit upkeep and repair, my aim is for the full amount in order to close out any other existing loans, and pay off all existing credit card debt. Note to potential investors: I currently have a Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months and always paid on time. That loan is $415/month approximately. The new loan would pay off that 3-year loan and all other debt. The new terms would be only $10 more per month for a 5-year loan. I hope this very small ($10) adjustment per month and my history of paying this and all debt 100% on time will help you in your investment decision.  I will pay off the new loan, if received, before the 5-year term. The extended timeframe is merely a safety net, which allows me to pay the minimum due from time to time, though I plan to pay more than due each month 90% of the time, if not always.",488xx,MI,18.26,0,6/1/94,1,48,NA,17,0,35.9,37,FALSE,0,NA,36%,1,T

On the low side my net income is $2810, I say low because I&rsquo;ve factored in missing 2-3 days incase of emergencies and incase no overtime/bonus  is given, my company currently allows unlimited OT due to my position and the demand for it.  My current YTD average monthly income is $5992 or ($47,166.15 YTD as of 8/27/2010)   My bills include  $700 monthly to Jared&rsquo;s min payment is 435 (will be paid off by March) $400 car payment $200 Credit Card Payments $115 Car Insurance $60 Gas (I drive a Prius so this is generous allowance) $200 Cable/Internet/phone    My fianc&eacute;e who is in her last year of Law school (she graduates in May) will move here to Texas and that will increase our income as well.  We&rsquo;ve both committed to living with my parents (where I live currently) until we pay off the wedding.  The reason why I&rsquo;m able to bank the $1000 is because they do not charge me rent or make me pay for utilities or even food.  My cable bill is high because instead of going out all the time I spend it at home saving money.   I have over $40,000 in my retirement accounts so in a crunch I could always withdraw funds from them to pay back the loan.  I have been very responsible with my money but now need a little help to pay for the wedding.  My parents threw us an engagement party and our families gave us monetary gifts that totaled $5000 (which we still have and will pay for parts of the wedding), we&rsquo;ll receive at least the same in wedding gifts if not more. I choose the 5 year repayment to plan for the worst and should have no troubles paying this loan.  My credit history also reflects that I have an excellent payment history.

Yes,M0700447,Charged Off,"Universal Janitorial Services, Inc.",10+ years,RENT,63129.36,n,"This is my first loan request and am looking to consolidate CC debt in tune of $13,604.65 as of today's balances. My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.  To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc.  Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.  My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year.  Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.  Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).  One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances).  I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough. I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed. Approval close. They said that they are still awaiting the IRS' response to the 4506T.

Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu.

No,M0738280,Fully Paid,NA,6 years,MORTGAGE,108041,n,"My reason for applying for this loan is to consolidate 2009 tax debt and unexpected medical expense debt.  In the last two quarters of 2009, my speech therapy practice grew faster than I had anticipated and I did not adjust my estimated tax payments accordingly. I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.   My approximate monthly budget :  Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)  Mortgage $2,298.00 Groceries $800.00 Insurance (auto/life) $320.00 Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone) Auto/ Fuel $220.00 Childcare: $400 Credit Card Payments: $572.00 Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00 Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00 Education: $1800.00 Medical $100.00 Savings $200.00 Other Non-Discretionary $250.00  IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo  These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.  If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.  I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.   I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited.

My family and I are looking to make a move and purchase a new home in this perfect buyers market. This loan would certainly guarantee that I become a 1st time home buyer this year. I believe that lenders should commit their funds to my loan because I am a low risk borrower. Being a tenured teacher I have a steady and safe job with a good salary.  I intend to pay the loan off in 2-3 years, possibly sooner. Luckily in CA as a 1st time home buyer I still have an opportunity to apply for the $10,000 tax credit that they extended until the end of this year. My intentions are to use the majority of the tax credit to pay off my loan. I do understand that there is a possibility that for some reason I may not receive the tax credit in full and that is why I mentioned 2-3 years to pay it off. I have a good credit score and good rapport with all of my creditors. I always pay within my terms and more often then not pay my balances off prior to the due dates. For example I just recently paid off my car approx 6 months ahead of schedule. My fiance and I have been pre-approved for a home mortgage loan of up to 325k, but given that this is our 1st home we are shopping in the market of 225k and below which would keep us well under our budget and not be overwhelming. I am the co-borrower on the mortgage loan and my fiance is the primary borrower. Even with this newly aquired debt of the personal loan our income to debt ratio will not be drastically affected. Our current combined annual income exceeds 100k and our debt to income ratio w/o our current rent and with this new loan payment is at approx 16%. Our debt to income ratio with our current rent payment of $950.00 and this new loan payment is approx 24%. The ideal debt to income ratio that mortgage lenders and investors would like to see is at 36% and we are well below that with our combined income and debts. This loan combined with some of our savings would help cover our 3.5% down payment on our 30 Year Fixed FHA loan as well as the closing and moving cost. I hope that this answers all of your questions and helps you instill the confidence in us to contribute to our loan.

I bring home about $3900 per month after payroll deductions and taxes, but this amount does vary depending on how many hours I work, and overtime, etc.  I do not have any other expenses for the salon because the stylists which are independent contractors are responsible for purchasing their own items and supplies, etc.  The only monthly debt payments I have personally totals $340, excluding housing. Including my housing it is $1,099. I do not have any credit card debt, no collections, and no bankruptcies. Conventional banks do not help people that are in my unique situation. My business is a cash business, and I have not applied for a lot of credit accounts, and the banks look down on that. I do not have a lot of open credit accounts because I do not really believe in credit cards.  I like to pay cash if I have it and that way I avoid getting into debt. I have been very responsible with credit and do not like to just open up accounts for the heck of it. Apparently this is not something that banks like, because they are saying that I do not have a lot of credit accounts. I only have 3 but that is enough for me. They want people to open up so many accounts so that you can drown in debt, but I have steered clear of that scenario. Please help me further my business venture because banks are not willing to help someone with a unique situation like me even though I have good credit scores.",605xx,IL,4.97,0,5/1/98,3,55,NA,4,0,1,26,FALSE,0,NA,1%,1,T

But please answer these two questions first please:   1. Do you hold the title to your home on *your own name*   2. How much equity do you have on your house? (please provide the home valuation and total balance of the mortgage/heloc loans)  Member_595101, Thank you for your question and possible financing.  To answer your questions, my home loan is in my husband and my name and is currently $127,299 with $747,00 of the $1,585 going to the principle.  We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.  I have set aside $900.00 in my bank account provided which is sperate from the family budget in order to pay the monthly payments.  Sorry for the delay in answering your question.  Have a nice day. In the notes section, lending club suggests to offer information regarding on how I will pay back this loan, stable employment, what makes me a good borrower, and monthly budget.  Stable Employment:  I started working at 15 Ìâå_ and have only been unemployed once in my life.  I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.  At that time it was good news since a severance package afforded me to stay home with my new baby, as well a return to college for a Microsoft Certification Program. I received my MCSE certification and began working for an IT Company where I worked for 9 Ìâå_ years.  During the 9 Ìâå_ years I moved up the chain and eventually transferred to an account that supported the City.  I was promoted to Network/Server Manager but transferred to my current position when there was an opening.  So realistically, I have been at this current location for over 11 years.  Five years doesnÌ¢åÛåªt sound very creditable.  Good Borrower:  For years I had a credit rating of over 820-840s, and want it back.  I allowed myself to be unselfish and naive to loan funds that were never repaid.  I just want this debt paid off and plan to look into helping others through this type of funding.  What a great opportunity.  Monthly Budget:  I have set aside $450.00 bi-monthly which will cover this payment.  How will I use this loan:  It will be used to consolidate my credit cards and I will be able to pay a lower interest rate, which can be paid off in 3 years.

No,M0368041,Fully Paid,Tighe Patton Armstrong Teasdale,8 years,MORTGAGE,131000,n,"I have been offered a partnership in my downtown Washington, D.C. law firm, but there is a hitch.  My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",220xx,VA,15.16,0,5/1/87,0,33,NA,8,0,67.9,16,FALSE,0,NA,68%,1,T

Let me make a correction...I put 10% for the credit cards. What I meant to say was I would rather pay a fixed interest rate of 10% on just one loan rather than pay a variable interest on 3 credit cards. Which each credit card is at least 18% interest.

I am a good borrower, as I have never, ever, been late on any loan or bill in my life. My first credit card was at 18, and though credit cards are not something an 18 year old should get into, I have always paid as agreed. I am down to one single credit card (medical from dental work), but hacksawing down on everything. I'm whittling down on higher interest items, to avoid loss in interest of course.  My monthly budget is as follows: Income: 2600 gross - 2032 net (take-home pay, excluding overtime/bonuses) Rent $375 Car Payment $201 Medical Credit Card (Credit Union) $80 or lower min-this is subject to paydowns at this present time, so it'll go lower) Cable and Internet $62 Food/groceries $240/month Fuel $40 - (I drive a Nissan Versa SL w/CVT, and work from home as a OSC Reporting Specialist now. I no longer have a commute :] Due to the mideast crisis, I see that going up to 60 soon.) Entertainment $50 LendingClub (currently $142, but of course will be lower) Electric $108 (Water/sewer/trash is paid where I live. 108 is max I have ever seen it, but tends to be about $70.)  Remaining for everything else/paydowns (assuming current bills): 714 NOTE: I do like to, and tend to double or triple the payment on the credit card when I have that extra money, however.... I would rather keep a little extra cash in the bank so I don't have to go back and cyclicly borrow/use a credit card, so I don't go 100% all-out.  My work stability: I have been with TeleTech Holdings, Inc for four years now, and have been trusted far beyond other employees in my scope of support. Originally, I was hired as a Technical Customer Service agent for the Dish Network client, then I was promoted several times to serve as Training Team Lead, QA Intern, QA Specialist I for HP, QA Specialist II for HP, QA Champion/Specialist III for HP and HP L3 Case Management, and now OSC Reporting Specialist for 26 different lines of business...  Providing sales, survey, and call service quality metrics for that many lines of business gives me the confidence of knowing if one contract/client decides to take business elsewhere, that I will still have 25 more clients to serve. My previous performance from launching projects to managing continued improvement speaks for itself, and consistently presents me with opportunities for growth and advancement.  Along with my performance, on a morale note, I love my job, and know that I have a positive effect on the US consumer, as none of my business lines are offshore. I truly feel that even at my age of 25, that with the people and stability of this debt-free company that I work for, that this is the company that I would eventually retire with.",658xx,MO,22.14,0,2/1/05,0,NA,NA,4,0,89.9,14,FALSE,0,NA,90%,1,T

Instead, four days later, I received an email from LC stating that the loan had been denied due to incomplete paperwork. I was shocked so I contacted them and fortunately got in touch with the person who denied my loan. I asked him that how come they didn't contact me when they were unable to obtain completed paperwork from me even after I had sent them everything via emails (I have the records to prove it). Their response was that the matter will be investigated and I would be contacted within 24 hours. A few days ago, I received another email requesting the paperwork. This time I sent PDF files and also faxed the documents. I spoke to them last night and they said that I needed to re-list the loan.  They confirmed that for the re-listed loan, they have already verified all information including employment, salary, and federal tax returns and if the loan is funded again, things would go smoothly.

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve CornellÌ¢åÛåªs alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wifeÌ¢åÛåªs part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means. We donÌ¢åÛåªt own boats, motorcycles, SUVs, pool, big-screen TV, or other frivolous depreciating assets.  My volvo 10 years old, my wifeÌ¢åÛåªs is 8 years old; both paid for and running great!

I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.  I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.  The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!  P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

No,M0347164,Fully Paid,LPL Financial,2 years,RENT,40000,n,"This loan will be used to paydown business debt from my early 20s.  My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.",708xx,LA,16.98,0,4/1/98,2,40,NA,4,0,62,12,FALSE,0,NA,62%,1,T

The reason I'm applying for the loan is because I'm moving out of the room I've been living in for the past three years.  I moved into a tiny, tiny room in Westchester County.  It was so small I didn't even have a closet.  These past few years I've learned to use the space to my advantage.  I want to move out now because I'm in a comfortable spot in my life to do so.  I found a place in the Bronx that isn't exactly above my pay grade but one where it would leave me a bit underfunded given my bills.  Between the apartment fees, utilities, medical bills, and other monthly bills I don't feel with the loan I have I'll be able to live decently.  So I need the loan.  I have a very good job at CBS Radio, but I don't make as much as I want. I plan on using the funds for several reasons primarily for moving out.  The initial apartment fees are roughly $4000 dollars which includes the first month, last month, security deposit and broker fee.  After writing out a careful budget of all my essential bills (i.e. rent, electric, phone, transportation, food, medical) I realized I wouldn't be able to live decently.  I needed help.  So I am turning to get some help. I'm also using the loan to consolidate the remaining amount of my credit cards, which stands at $3700 dollars.  The remaining amount will be added to my account to help pay for my rent and other essential costs.  I want to mention that I am an extremely hardworking guy who constantly monitors his credit score.  I currently hold an average score of 750. I always pay my bills, pay more than the minimum, and keep an eye on what I spend. Living on my own has been a goal of mine for some time now.  I suppose part of the reason was I was tired of sharing bathrooms, listening to loud music at inappropriate times, constantly eating out and living in a room without a closet I think it's time to pack up and move.  Life has this way of telling you when to hold them and fold them and I think it's time to fold and live on my own.

I will be using this loan to consolidate three credit cards. I have never missed or made a late payment on these credit cards or on any other debt. I discovered Lending Club and found that the rates available here are less than what I am paying on my credit cards. As I indicated above I have never missed a payment, and the monthly payment for this loan is roughly half what I am paying now. I will be repaying this loan well in advance of the 5 year term. My payment history on all debts is flawless.  However, I am told that my credit score has suffered as a result of the following: &bull;My debt to income ratio is too high.  A couple things you may want to know about this. oMy monthly income is $9200 and I have been with my employer for over 10 years.  My wife&rsquo;s monthly income is $3900.  Combined monthly income is $13,100.  As you can see making this payment is well within our means. oThis loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report. oThere are two homes on my credit report.  One of them is a vacation home that I rent out. oWe have a family member that lives with us who also contributes towards paying bills.  &bull;My credit card balances are high in comparison to their credit limits oAs you may be aware with the recent bank crisis many banks have started lowering credit limits on existing accounts.  Since my limits have been lowered my balance is now closer to the card limit. oBy paying off my credit cards I expect to see my credit score go back up since my total balance will be a smaller percentage of my total available credit.  My point being that I am very interested in improving my credit score so defaulting on this loan is the farthest thing from my mind.  Please feel free to share any thoughts or questions you may have. Thank you, My original description read &quot;This loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  This should have read &quot;This loan will of course all be used to pay off credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  Sorry for any confusion.

In short, this is a sales position with a heavy emphasis on managing the relationship with a variety of high profile government customers. Kindest regards, I saw a few investors had asked other loan requesters about their 401k.  So I thought it might be relevant to add that my wife and I have a combined $120,000 in our 401ks.  I hope this will add to your confidence in funding our loan. Thank you. I want to say thank you to all of you that have invested with me so far.

Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollar‰Ûªs ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read‰Û_ well I won‰Ûªt digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance.

I'm a young professional who is financially savvy and ready to pay off credit card debt in order to save and invest in my future. I'm in a very stable position regarding my career as an insurance broker and have recently received a salary increase that will allow me to become debt-free. That being said, I'd much rather deal with this interest rate than my current CC rate (16.99%). If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to ask. I appreciate your help and look forward to being in your shoes soon. Thank you. Lending Club, As I wait for my listing to post this evening, I thought it would be prudent to proactively answer some common questions you may have prior to deciding to fund this note.  This is obviously an investment on your end and I want to make you as comfortable as possible regarding the following items:  my compensation structure/job security, current debt obligations, monthly expenses/budget, and my regimented plan to become completely debt-free.  As I mentioned in my initial description, I plan to be in your shoes once this loan is paid back in full. &bull;	What is AmWINS Group Inc.? What is your job title and what are your duties? I work for the largest property and casualty wholesale brokerage firm in the U.S.  I have been with them for a total of 5 years (including an internship while in college) and really enjoy my job. My current title is Producer (Broker) and I specialize in the Healthcare Industry.  I facilitate/negotiate the essential property and casualty insurance products that hospitals must purchase in order to protect themselves so they can provide us care when we need it. My career is going very well and I certainly have no intention of going anywhere.  To be honest, I&rsquo;d like to retire from here years down the road! My compensation structure is salary-based with potential for an annual bonus.  I have provided my monthly income (based on salary only) and will try to figure out how to verify that with LC today to increase your comfort level. &bull;	What debt obligations do you currently have (please provide balances, interest rates) and which debts do you intend to pay off with this loan? Mastercard - $7,000 @ 16.99% Visa - $3,000 @ 9.99% I will pay off each of these amounts in full upon this note being fully funded. &bull;	Can you list your monthly itemized expenses and their amounts? Rent - $600 per month Car Payment - $206 per month The only other monthly expenses are utilities, groceries, gas, etc. &bull;	Monthly Budget Gross Income = $5,000 Net Income = $3,400 (after taxes, benefits costs, etc.) &bull;	My Plan (with your help!) Once I receive the $10k loan from my investor(s), I will eliminate the debt I currently have the high interest rate.  While my recent salary increase has certainly assisted me in working towards eliminating debt and building a foundation for my future, I just can&rsquo;t justify continuing to pay the interest rates associated with each CC.  My credit score and history have allowed me to work with each of you at a rate that would be unintelligent to pass up. The monthly payment was calculated at $306.67 per month, but I will be putting $500 towards the loan amount each month.  I know this will cut the loan term a bit short and that will affect your total money earned, but you will be making a financially-sound decision.  On another note, you would really be helping me become established and allow me to look forward to the exciting next steps in my life (engagement ring, home purchase, etc.).  With a planned payment of $500 each month, I will have this completely paid off by September 2012 and then be in the position to help someone else out.

I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, I‰Ûªve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The ‰ÛÏone man‰Û shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, ‰ÛÏall you can eat‰Û support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. It‰Ûªs also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a company‰Ûªs IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etc‰Û_) A typical ‰ÛÏcomputer‰Û company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business I‰Ûªve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. It‰Ûªs a tool to help get the next level.  3.	Personal Growth: I have had to change my personal mentality from being a computer tech to an entrepreneur who manages a growing company.

I have excellent credit, and would be happy to answer any investors questions if you need further details. Personal Plea!  First THANK YOU to everyone who has invested so far! I appreciate your support. Second, I would like to take a few moments to appeal to any would-be investors.  This is the most I have ever been in debt, and I am trying frantically to climb out as fast as I can.  Like I said, I have incurred several 1 time expenses that had to be put on my credit card including medical expenses, car repairs, and thanks to a mix-up by my former employer, some back taxes.  I am applying for this loan to get a lower interest rate.  I have an excellent payment history. I also have excellent job security. I am a postdoctoral fellow, currently doing neurobiology research.  Currently I have a 3-year contract, with an option to renew after that. In addition, I am a licensed pharmacist, so if anything were to happen, I could always pick up a pharmacy job, so my income is very very secure at this time. During my time as a graduate student, I received a small but decent stipend.  Despite all the debt I incurred, I was still able to pay off my car, and pay off some undergraduate loans during my graduate school career.  At this time, I am still making all my payments on time, and making progress on paying down my debt. This loan is very vital, as it will allow me to pay down my debt faster, and will allow me to get away from high credit card interest rates.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for taking time to consider financing my loan.

We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.

I would like to add, that my long, positive credit history supports the fact that I honor my financial committments, having never once defaulted on a debt.

The potential application of this design concept is huge, and currently there is nothing like it in the marketplace.  It enables the interchangeability (transform/morph) of different art, quotations, and graphic expressions on display.  After the design patent was granted in 2008, I slowly and gradually worked on preparing to get the brand off the ground.  This year, after sourcing materials and getting other resources in place, the 1st and 2nd prototypes are finally completed, with the 2nd improving by leaps and bound over the first.

About the Loan:  I have been paying Sallie Mae faithfully every month for two years now and only $700 has come off the principal on my student loan of $5000. They estimate that I have another 7 years left to pay it off at their 11.8% interest rate. I would much rather have it paid off in 3 years, while paying off my credit cards as well.  I have four credit cards, two of which are fully paid off. They have a total limit of over $30,000. I have $6500 charged to two of them leftover from when I was in college. Both have the same high interest rates they had when I got them during school (one is around 15% and the other is about 18%).  With this loan, I intend to pay off the Sallie Mae remainder ($4300) and these cards ($6500) in one convenient monthly payment.

With the ongoing urban explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an alternate industry has filled the void left by the state. Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcÌ¢åÛå_ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.  The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, Ì¢åÛåÏStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in AfricaÌ¢åÛå, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses.  The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)  To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo) I will be the General Manager in this business.",750xx,TX,8.04,0,11/1/05,1,NA,NA,7,0,85.6,8,FALSE,0,NA,86%,1,T

Yes,M0364688,Charged Off,Pixsy Corporation,1 year,RENT,55000,n,"LOAN PURPOSE  This loan will be used by my business partner and I to buy an under-valued, under-nourished existing business.  BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash.

No,M0703626,Fully Paid,North Richland Hills Police Department,1 year,RENT,32200,n,"Sorry about the confusion about the type of loan that I need, it's my first time doing this so I was not aware of that. I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them.

I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.

At the time, my goal was to pay off the cards in 5 years.  I managed to bring it down from 11K from 2 years ago to about 8K today. My debt is around 8500 right now, and paying approximately 400 to 600 per month. Have a handful of credit cards which interest charges ranges from 10% to 24%. My old plan was to pay off the lowest balance card first, which thankfully in my case was the highest interest rate card and work my way through the highest balance eventually. Now I realized that it made more sense to consolidate the high interest loans into a single rate, low payment plan especially now that we are expecting our first child. Consolidating the loans would lower our monthly payments as well as allowing us to divert that extra money towards child care costs, and perhaps also towards building our emergency fund which we had greatly neglected for the longest time.

Credit card balances/interest rates are as follows: Citi - 4,562.22 @ 14.990 Amex - 2,042.24 @ 15.210 Wells Fargo - 1,918.61 @ 6.65 (just want to pay this balance off already) *Have other balances on department store cards which I am paying off separately this month, totalling approximately $800.

No,M0624503,Fully Paid,Producers Inc,3 years,MORTGAGE,67000,n,"The new credit card rules have resulted in the interest rate for my credit cards to increase even though I have never missed or been late with a payment. During college I created my debt and have had the same steady job since graduating. I'm hoping to finally eliminate my debt once and for all. The only thing that negatively impacts my credit score is my revolving balances, which is what I plan to remove with this loan. I'm more than happy to answer any questions about me or my intended use for this loan. I've read through some other available loans and noticed some common questions that lenders ask. To be proactive I've put together some details providing my answers to those questions.  I. Background Information  I graduated from college in 12-2006 with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics/Computers. I have also taken actuarial exams in order to be further my career as an actuary. During college I ended up getting married and having a son. Going to school fulltime, and taking care of my family resulted in my accumulation of credit card debt. While my debt was building the interest rates were in the mid single digit range, so I wasn't careful enough with the use of the credit cards. Even as late as last February my rates were so low that instead of paying off my debt, I used the money I had saved for a down payment on my house. I've also used savings to pay off student loans instead of my credit cards. Now that my credit card companies have severely increased my rates, the balance grows more and more each month. I've never missed or been late with payments on any bills. I have a lot of recent inquiries on my credit report because I have recently purchased a used car and compared quotes from many different companies. Also, for the past month I have been actively searching for ways to consolidate my credit card debt.  II. Employment Information  I work for Producers Incorporated located in Central Florida. I'm an actuarial analyst and help manage the sales, administration, and customer service departments for the company. The company has 35-40 employees and I work directly with the owner overseeing all areas of the business. The company sells various insurances and investments. I have been working there since 01-2007 when I graduated from college.  III. Monthly Expenses  Mortgage- $1,412 Auto Loan- $321 Car Insurance- $120 Electric- $150 Water- $90 Cell Phone- $100 Tv- $75 Internet- $25 Minimum Payments on Cards Not Consolidating- $410 Minimum Payments on Card I Want to Consolidate- $433 Current Total- $3,136 After Consolidating total- $3,278 (Replacing the minimum payments on cards I consolidate with the monthly loan payment)  IV. Loan Goal  My goal with this loan is to pay off the 3 credit cards with the highest interest rates. I'm hoping to pay off the cards so I can start cancelling them and reign in my revolving credit lines. By consolidating my debt with this loan, I'll be able to pay off close to $16,000 in debt over 3 years, by only increasing my monthly payment by $142.

He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.  Our goal is to soft-open on August 28th with a grand-opening on September 19th, 2009.

I generally pay 50% or 100% more than the minimum payment on these, prioritizing on interest rate. ~3k = FIA ~3k = Chase ~1k = Amex ~1k = Capital One ~14k = FIA (cosigned with my dad, and this is much of my revolving debt)  I realize that this is slightly lower than my ~33k credit report listing, but I paid off one chase card in full in the last month, at nearly 4k, which doesn't seem to have been reported yet. Another common question is a breakdown of monthly expenses: Mortgage: 870 Car payment (ends in Jan 2011): 540 Utilities: 250 Phone: 120 Food: 500 Credit cards: 800  Also (another common question): I'm a software engineer.

I have had my job for 9 years and am in negotiations about getting into ownership with the owners.  I have acquired debt over the last four years of my life for three main reasons.  I had knee surgery a year ago and had medical bills that added up.  I also have two daughters under the age of two, so these medical bills were in addition to the knee surgery.  I am currently enrolled in college where I am about to receive my Associate's in Business Administration with honors.  I will be continuing my education and pursuing, ironically enough, a Bachelor's in Accounting.  The school loans have added to my debt.  I have never been late on a payment for any reason and do not have trouble making any of my current payments.  The two differences between my current situation and receiving this loan are the payments and interest rate.  By making equal payments, to which I pay now, on this loan, I can pay off my debt in 3 years as opposed to 20.  I appreciate any and everyone who takes time to read this description and consider investing in my cause.  I am not looking for handouts or an easy way out, but a way to save myself money and to give myself a second chance.  I do not want to ruin my credit score with any type of debt program.  I plan on marrying the mother of my two children once I have my debt reduced.   Any further questions or need for any additional information, please feel free to message or email me. Thank you so much to everyone who has invested in my cause so far.  21.43% in only 35 hours is amazing.  Only $11,000 more to go.

Over the past year, with the assistance of the VA Vocational Rehabilitation program, I have invested over $100,000 in Operation: ROCK the HOUSE which is outlined below.  I did something similar while I was in the service in Germany.  Op: ROCK the HOUSE has a pretty tight timeline that doesn‰Ûªt allow for intermittent delays (troops are returning everyday) like I have encountered in applying for a Patriot Express Loan. I am asking for $1,400 that will be used as working capital and operational expenses to continue the project until either my Patriot Express Loan or one of the other repayment scenarios comes through. 	 By investing so much, I ran up my credit cards to the point that my RLU has taken a toll on my standard 720 credit score.  Thus, a portion of this loan will be used to pay down the credit cards and improve my RLU.  Once I receive the Patriot Express Loan this loan will then be repaid in full. 	 The next several repayment scenarios involve the VA.  One, the VA VocRehab program reimburses me for the majority of my investment and this loan is paid off; two, the VA gets around to processing a VA disability claim I have in the neighborhood of $30,000 and this loan is paid off; or, three, and coincidentally the day my wife looks forward to the most, the VA finally processes another claim I have that amounts to roughly $75,000 in back-benefits and this loan is paid off.    Lastly, a large department store chain has asked to receive samples of our product line.  A portion of this loan will go toward having the samples manufactured.  The revenues from sells of the products will allow the loan to be serviced if not repaid entirely.  Of all the scenarios, this one is my favorite. 	 Thank you for your interest and hopefully your support.  Regardless, we look forward to seeing you during Op: ROCK the HOUSE.  Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is a ‰ÛÏHomecoming Celebration‰Û for service members by a service member. It lasts all summer long and is performed in three major acts. 	Act 1: May 5, 2009‰ÛÓDrop date. The release of a unique compilation CD, that has notable artists performing songs written by disabled Army veteran, Jet West.   	OBJECTIVE: A theme song and ‰ÛÏcelebration soundtrack‰Û to provide a means of national identity, espirit de corps, and party music for a nation-wide celebration in honor of returning American troops.  	Act 2: May 23-25, Memorial Day Weekend‰ÛÓShort Shots Leg 2, Short Shots, occurs as people across America shoot short video clips for the homecoming music video.  	OBJECTIVE: Embody the spirit of rebirth in the nation as it brings about new hope with new promise for all generations and celebrate the American military members who keep it possible.  	Act 3: September 4-7, Labor Day Weekend‰ÛÓTrooptastic Finale Three days of concerts held simultaneously in three cities with performers rotating between cities.   	Active military and veterans admitted free with government-issued picture ID‰ÛÓavailable free through the VA. Ticket prices set in inverse proportion to corporate sponsorship. Seeded with sales of the CD. 	OBJECTIVE: A national event to honor and celebrate the work of the military men and women who keep us free. 	Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is the brain child of disabled Army veteran and former Soldier of the Year, Jet West. Jet West Music Group Ltd is getting its start through the VA VocRehab program with financing made possible by LendingClub.com, the SBA Patriot Express Loan Initiative for veterans and, of course,  the thousands of contributors to Operation: ROCK the HOUSE. Jet West Music Group intends to use proceeds from these events to expand the entertainment options of service members stationed around the world far into the future starting with shows for the service members who missed Operation: ROCK the HOUSE.",891xx,NV,5.07,0,2/1/03,2,NA,NA,3,0,NA,6,FALSE,0,NA,NA,1,V

No,M0661335,Fully Paid,GE,< 1 year,RENT,66000,n,"Over an 8 year period I accrued some $30,000 in credit card debt while attending undergrad, and later, law school.   The legal job market has been particularly difficult to break into (even the Harvard, Yale and Stanford kids are having trouble), but after nearly a year of searching, I have landed firmly in a fantastic position with seemingly endless room for growth, and a more-than-decent starting salary.  I have paid off about $5k toward my debt in the past 4 months, however a large percentage of that money went toward interest.  My average APR is somewhere near 26 percent, though I have not missed a payment in more than four years.  I am wholeheartedly committed to paying down this debt in full within the coming 36 months.  After that, I hope to become an investing member of LendingClub.  If you have any questions or would like further details, please ask!  Thank you for having faith in me. In an attempt to make this process as easy as possible, I have read through many current loan applications that are undergoing funding.  I've found that lenders often would like to know the names, balances, and APRs of cards that borrowers intend to pay down/pay off with the loan funds received from LendingClub.  To that end, I have placed that information below.  LENDER    BAL     APR      MIN PYMT   Time to Pay off@ MIN PYMT Discover $4,425 @29.99 -  minimum $134 - 18 years Chase    $5,725  @20.24 - minimum $154    28 years GM Card $10,727 @ 22.90 - minimum $311  29 years MBNA (BoA) $4,918 @26.24 minimum $153   25 years  The total of my minimum payments on these cards is currently $752.  I *always* pay at least this much, but sometimes more.  For example, I paid an extra $2000 toward the above-referenced Discover card in February.  In response, Discover (understandably) accepted the money and reduced my credit line by $2k.  The new payment on the loan I am seeking from LendingClub would be under $900 per month.  In just THREE years, I will have paid off 95 percent of the four loans found above.  This will be accomplished simply by paying $150 per month above my current minimums!  3 Years through LendingClub vs. 20+ years through the credit card companies is a ""no-brainer"" for me.  One last thing I would like to mention.  I have noticed that LendingClub members often worry that a prospective borrower will pay off the loan ahead of schedule.  At this time, it is my intention to take the full 36 month term to pay off the loan I am seeking.  If I receive substantial raises over the next two years, I might then decide to accelerate repayment.  Full Disclosure =)  Thank you again. Edited to add:  My loan payment--if granted--from LendingClub will actually only be $832/month.  This is just $80 more than my current monthly minimums as described above.  I had previously stated I would be paying $150 per month above my current monthly minimums, so this makes the LendingClub loan option even more advantageous! I have just submitted my pay stub and employment verification information to LendingClub Home Office.  Hopefully they will update my status to verified/approved shortly!",064xx,CT,18.95,0,9/1/99,0,31,NA,10,0,68.5,21,FALSE,0,NA,68%,1,V

I also applied to receive a new American Express card for the intention of transferring the balance, but even though I was accepted, I was again refused the balance transfer. All my transfering and paying off my other high APR cards, lowered my credit score. But I have had good credit all my life, paying all my bills on time. Please, help me pay off this card so I can avoid paying an extra $100 a month, and be much closer to being debt free.  Thank you.",913xx,CA,16.11,0,11/1/97,2,NA,NA,12,0,52.1,25,FALSE,0,NA,52%,1,V

I promised my wife that one day she would get that wedding.  That time has come... the big day is jsut 3 weeks away!

We are seeking some help to take the worry off our shoulders- allowing us to enjoy this moment without the stresses of money being present.  The $3000 we are seeking to borrow would be going towards the balance due to the caterer, the flowers (we are frugal and have decided to get the flowers from Costco), bridal hair and make-up, and the wedding favors for the guests.  Please know that paying this loan back would be a top priority for me.  I don't take borrowing lightly.  At this moment the time is short as the balances are due in about 10 days.

I have a research program that is actively funded by the National Institutes of Health.  What is important about these two points is that I have job stability and a steady, strong source of income.  I am never late on bills, which include student loans, a mortgage, car payment, and credit cards and personal loans.  I am looking to actively pay down debt over the next several years, starting with two accounts.  One is a credit card through Chase that was through Washington Mutual.  When the card transferred to Chase, the interest rate climbed from 10% to 29.99%.  Again, while I have never been late on a payment and continue to make the monthly minimum, I will be unable to pay down the debt (which now stands at just under $3,000) as quickly as I would like and desire a lower rate, something they cannot give to me for 12 months.   Also, a promotional purchase (centrail air installation and furnace work) on a Home Depot card is about to expire, and with it about a $1,000 of interest will be added to the principal amount (now just under $4000) of the loan.  This, combined with the high interest rate (26.99%, which also increased earlier this summer), will make it difficult for me to pay down the debt.  These two accounts are the two primary roadblocks to my plan to decrease my non-mortgage and student loan-related debts.    While my salary provides me with a reasonable debt-to-income ratio, it might sound strange that I underestimated the financial impact of my son following his birth in March of last year.  He began daycare last November, and the $200 weekly daycare payment has made disposable income at a premium, and my desire to make well more than the monthly minimums difficult.

For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.   Thank you!",335xx,FL,13.43,0,12/1/91,0,NA,89,6,1,93.8,14,FALSE,0,NA,94%,1,V

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan ""B"" was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan ""C"" is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan ""C"".  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job.

No,M0200175,Fully Paid,Cullum Constructors,1 year,RENT,30000,n,"About me: I'm a young, ambitious, and excited student, father and future husband. The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal ""you give me money, I say thanks and make payments"" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctor‰Ûªs bills and auto repairs from last year. All of that is now resolved and we are paying everything down, and I‰Ûªve never missed a payment on anything.",294xx,SC,29.6,0,9/1/03,1,0,0,6,0,58.5,6,FALSE,0,NA,58%,1,V

Like many others we were caught in the credit limit - interest rate changes recently imposed by lenders. They cut your limit so your percentage of limit used goes up, so they raise your rate.  We are current on all our debts and this loan will put more of our payment towards principal rather than more interest.  Our debt to income ratio is great at less than 20%.  The company I work contracts to the Federal Government for developing database systems, software and other technical systems. I've been employed with them the last 3 years and our outlook is bright with one of our programs being identified as a special interest program by the Under-Secretary of Defense-IT. Our company recently expanded in this slow economy, increasing our man power by 15%, with additional needs being project for the future to support system service contracts. This is to answer some questions that seem to be common.

We are not incurring additional debt and are aggressively paying down our balances.  Our GE account will be paid off before September, allowing us to avoid over ~$2500 in accrued interest. This will also free up an additional $400/mo to pay down our debt.  Most of this debt was incurred in a failed business. Economy turned on us and new Federal regulation made it unfeasible. Some was from school.  We currently have a mortgage 1660/mo including tax & ins. Value is 325K with a loan of 245K@4 5/8% with 22/23 years left and is in our name. We also do not have a HELOC.

The card had nearly $40,000 on it at one point and it's down to $18,000. It is in my Grandmother's name because my dad lost a job 15 years back that ruined his credit and she offered the card to them. They have never missed a payment. It is their number 1 financial priority. They are going to continue to pay the note. My Grandmother's nerves just can't handle the card being in her name anymore so this is the solution to get it out of her name. They are as good as gold to pay it off and of course you can see that I make pretty good money with little overhead, so I would step up to make the payments if my parents can't. Thank you for your consideration. This means a lot to my family! 582167 added on 12/01/09 > Ok so I just got an email from someone asking a lot more questions. The summary of what I sent them is this: I have a good job that I don't expect to lose anytime soon, certainly within the life of the loan. I am educated and would find a way to live in a box and make it work if not! I keep a strict budget and was able to save over $15000 this year. My parents have been paying over $700/ month on this card for over 10 years so I don't expect them to do anything different for the next 3. I will actually be paying half of the monthy payments. I just dropped my golf membership so my financial situation is only getting better. I have enough money (over $18,000 and counting) in my retirement accounts to pay the loan off if it comes to that. If you have any more questions, please ask. I know it's hard to trust anyone these days, but all I have are words to express that I essentially guarantee you will get paid back with your due interest! 582167 added on 12/01/09 > This is site is really neat.

I run an Internet marketing company and I am seeking funds to help launch my latest and greatest project, a Chicago community website.  Funds will mostly be used for web development work and initial marketing expenses.  The website will make money from network sponsorships. Due to our already established local connections we already have many paying clients lined up waiting for the website to launch. These payments will be significantly higher then our monthly loan repayment which will allow us to pay the loan off early.  We estimate the loan will be paid off in full in 12-16 months. We consider this a safe loan because even if the business is a complete flop (not likely!) I have an existing income stream from other websites that will more then cover the payments with no hassle. Payments will be automatic and always on time. I am also investing a great deal of my own cash into this project, so I have complete faith in the business.

No,M0448641,Fully Paid,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,5 years,MORTGAGE,85000,n,"I am seeking a loan for a kitchen remodel.  My wife and I have obtained detailed cost estimates for the project, which sum to $28,300.  At this time, we have $18,000 saved for the project, and a loan of $12,000 from the Lending Club would provide us with the difference (plus a margin of additional funds for the unexpected).  We bought our house at the end of 2005, which was just about at the peak of housing prices in our area.  We put 20% down on our house at purchase, and have a fixed rate mortgage at 6%.  Although cursory appraisals do not indicate that we are Ì¢åÛåÏupside downÌ¢åÛå with our mortgage, we have not had any success securing a traditional home equity loan though either our local credit union or a large national bank.  It appears that our situation is typical for these strange economic times: we have strong credit scores, a reasonable financing goal and steady income, but limited options for borrowing for remodeling.  Hence, we decided to turn to the Lending Club to finance this project.   My wife and I have two kids, ages 5 and 7, and we expect that our current house will be our Ì¢åÛåÏforever houseÌ¢åÛå.  We do not view our home as a short- or medium-term investment; it is simply where we want to live.  That stated, our kitchen is the weakest part of our house, and so we expect a relatively high return on this remodeling project.  Should something terrible happen and we are forced to sell our house, Lending Club lenders would share a proportionally small fraction of this risk, since our own funds will support well over half of the cost of the remodeling project.  My income is very reliable: I have a Ph.D. and a tenure-track position at a major research institution.  I have held this position for nearly six years.  My annual reviews have been very positive, and I have every indication that I will spend my career here.  In addition, over the last year I have had success with private consulting, which is the source for much of our savings.    I have been married for 11 years.  My wife is a painter, and is doing quite well on the local art scene.  Naturally, she has a day job, which is in the area of  non-profit administration. She has worked on and off in this area for over ten years, and she has held her current position for over four years.  It is a part-time situation that supports our finances but leaves her afternoons free to spend time in the studio before the kids get home from school.     As my credit report shows, we have consistently managed our finances responsibly.  The one blemish on my report is from a mortgage payment I missed a few years ago: I failed to update our automatic bill payment after our mortgage rate was adjusted (former mortgage, again our current mortgage is fixed).  If I recall correctly I underpaid by $26, but the lender was unsympathetic and reported it despite my pleadings.  Our current mortgage payment is approximately 20% of our gross income, and we pay on time, always.  We quit using credit cards about two years ago.  I have two modest car payments: $200 and $270.  The latter is for a car I bought my mother, who has been on disability since I was a teen and needs our help.   The estimated payment for the loan we are seeking will be in the vicinity of $375/month.  This is about what we paid in preschool tuition for my 5-year-old last year.  But he is going to kindergarten, and we will soon be relieved of this expenditure.  So, in effect, our monthly finances will change little when we take on this remodeling loan, and we know that we will be comfortable with this payment.  Taking the new payment into account, our monthly household debt-to-income ratio (not including mortgage) will be about 12%.",025xx,MA,6.58,0,7/1/93,0,59,NA,7,0,0,30,FALSE,0,NA,0%,1,V

My plan is to put Kiosks on college campuses, which Red Box doesn't touch. 4. DVD Kiosks are set to explode.

The property, a 4-bedroom single family home, is located in Richmond, Virginia's up and coming Church Hill neighborhood.  I currently have funds to purchase the property in cash, without the need for a mortgage, but am short of funds needed for light rehab work to make the property safe and comfortable enough for a family to call home. The home inspection revealed some unanticipated issues that I would like to resolve before renting the property. Qualified contractors will be hired to perform a majority of the work due to personal time constraints with my job.  Assuming a conservative estimate for rental rate and operating costs, income generated on the property should greatly exceed expenses.  As a result, I will likely repay this loan in full prior to the end of the term.  A bit more about me: I am a C-level executive at an Inc 500 company where I have worked for the past 4 years.

My monthly expenses are as follows: Rent: $900.00; Car Insurance for myself and my two daughters is: $163.77; I have no car payment; my utilities average between 120.00-232.00, depending on the time of year.

I have always made my payments and have strong sense of responsiblity in fulfilling and any and all obligations I am responsible for. The last year and half has been an extremely tough for my family and I. As is with a lot of people I realize. My oldest daughter had some personal issues that as a mother I could not turn her away, so I helped her. In  helping her I aquired debt on my credit cards. Additionally there were medical problems that my insurance company did not cover or they only paid a certain percentage. I was forced to put the balances on my cards. It has been a very difficult time, but I am deteremined to make it through. I appreciate any help that can be given. I have always honored my debts and have always strived to do the best with what I have been given. I have never, nor do I ever intend to file bankruptcy. I will do what is necessary and work as hard as is necessary to fulfill my obligations. Thank you for any consideration you give me. Best wishes.... I wanted to added that I orignally thought my 10 anniversary date at my job was in April, I have been informed it will be June. My start date was not considered until after the probationary period new hires go through. I apologize for the inaccurate information I provided previously. I have had several investors today ask the particulars regarding the remaining revolving credit not combined in this loan request. I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family.  The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38;  I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked.

Despite my shrinking debt, my immediate payment and my excellent payment history, the bank has now jacked my interest rate up to an astonishing amount.  Worse yet, the bank applies my payments to the lowest interest rate portions first, while the higher rate purchases simply keep accruing interest.

I want to close my credit card account with this bank to protect my future.  I am looking for a loan to match (or come very close to) the rate of my credit card balance before this one late payment: 3.99%  I have the ability to transfer the balance to a different credit card, but then I would be charged an additional 3% up-front for the privilege, and that really doesn't help me financially.

I have a secured job and am well paid.  I have 3 1/2 years more of alimony to pay so it would be nice to have a little more cash cushion over this time period.  I work in an investment firm as a senior member of the legal team and am focused on financial product design.  I don't have any problem at all paying my bills and have great credit. There have been a few questions so thought I would provide a couple more details.  It would seem odd that with 23k a month coming in that I need a cushion.  The reality is that after taxes that is 16k (+/-) and my alimony/child support payment is currently 10k so that leaves me 6k in cash each month.  My thought is that (and I won't break down my bills in granular format) I could use an extra 500 to 1k a month and this is a good way to get that backstop.  Importantly, there is a time horizon on these large payments as my lovely ex-wife gets her last payment in 2014.  So, I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Other question has been is there real estate exposure on my books or something else creating a real liability.  The answer is no.  I am just renting right now and will buy eventually.

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities.

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.

I've just paid off all of my debt and am in good financial position, but do not have the cash on hand today to pay for this whole trip.  I could put this on a credit card, but I really prefer the structure and better interest rates of a personal loan.  I used Lending Club to consolidate some student loan debt and it was a great experience.  I know my lenders would agree.

While my financial situation is extremely stable - I have a 4% Debt to Income Ratio and I currently utilize 13% of my open credit, the rate offered here is far better than the one on any credit card, and we are also keeping money in savings for an eventual car / house down payment (12 - 18 months from now).  The amount I am asking for is the remaining amount of what used to be over $20,000 in veterinary bills, stemming from an emergency enterotomy (canine), complications from the surgery, knee surgery for torn CCL (canine), MRIs and treatment for MRSA (canine). Additionally, we have been paying normal medical bills (human). We greatly appreciate your support; I am willing to offer further information if needed. My debt to income ratio is 4% and I currently use 13% of my credit limits (87% open credit). I have had a perfect credit history since January of 2002, including 0 late payments and several different types of accounts (including an installment loan and credit card accounts).

I am also a Lending Club lender and as such, will try to answer the questions I see asked most often in listings. However, if I have miss anything, ask away and I'll do my best to answer.  Employment ========== I am a software engineer for a privately funded startup company. The company has been in existence for right at 2 years and I have been with them for 1.5. We integrate biometric solutions with banking software. Our investor is founder and chairman of one of the most widely used core banking systems in the world, which gives us a unique advantage as a startup. I will be traveling to Africa in October to install our second client. We also have 5 more signed contracts awaiting installation over the next 2 years.  Home Equity =========== I refinanced my house earlier this year in order to convert it from a 7/1 ARM to a fixed 30-year and reduce the rate. The appraisal came in at $220,000.00 during the refinance while Zillow estimates the property at $213,000.00. I currently owe $175,000.00 on the house and there is no second mortgage or HELOC associated with the house, only the first mortgage. When refinancing, I made a large payment at closing in order to reduce the amount owed to just under 80%, thus avoiding PMI. However, this payment wiped out most of the savings that would have been used to finance the wedding.  Debts ===== I do have two credit cards whose balances have risen recently due to some of the initial wedding expenses. They are both American Express cards. One is at $3400 while the other is at $2500. The rates on these two cards are both at 13.24%. The first $5900 from this loan will go directly to paying off these two cards.  Budgeting ========= I follow a 60 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 budgeting scheme and use Mint to manage my finances. 10% to retirement, 10% to long term savings, 10% to short term savings, 10% to fun, and the rest, 60%, to cost of living (mortgage, lending club loan payment, bills, clothes, gas, etc.). Each of the first three 10% amounts are auto-drafted on pay day. This leaves my budget roughly as outlined below:  $4820 : Net Monthly Income -------------- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 -------------- $500 : Retirement $500 : Long Term Savings $500 : Short Term Savings $500 : Fun ---------------------- 60 --------------------- $1250 : Mortgage $130 : Mobile Phone (Family Plan) $100 : Power (average over last 3 bills) $30 : Gas (rounded average over last 3 bills) $22 : Garbage (rounded average over last 3 bills) $36 : Lawn $16 : Water (rounded average over last 3 bills) $400 : Groceries (rounded average over last 3 months) ===================================================== $836  The 60% can obviously fluctuate, but with the savings already factored in, there should be plenty of wiggle room. In addition, I have not adjusted my tax withdrawals, which left me with a more than $3000 return this past year. I intend on reducing my withholdings, which would increase my montly income beyond what is listed here.  Intentions ========== The three year term on this loan is seen as a worst case to me. I plan, and hope, to have the loan paid off in 2 - 2.5 years.",300xx,GA,3.01,0,6/1/95,3,38,NA,9,0,16.5,19,FALSE,0,NA,16%,1,H

During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again.

I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also.

No,M1169270,Current,READINGTON FARMS,8 years,MORTGAGE,74000,n,"Hi, I am looking for a loan to get out of credit card debt.   I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.

I am a good candidate for this loan because I have over come some really major hurtles in the past 8 years; divorce & relocation to another state by myself and have been able to stay afloat (meeting all financial commitments).  Unfortunately, my ‰ÛÏD‰Û credit rating is a result of difficulties  during those years of  the divorce & relocation.  I have made steady fiscal progress with each passing year.  My last big hurtle to reaching my goal of financial freedom is eliminating lingering bad debt.  No longer do I utilize credit cards to live!  When I moved to my current state of residence I accepted a state government job for $9.00/hr and no benefits in hopes of ‰Û÷making something happen‰Ûª with my life.  Within two months I had a position on the regular payroll with benefits and have progressed from that entry level position into a management position.  I am now one of the ‰Û÷go to gals‰Ûª for others in my professional community because of my integrity and experience in our field.  Presently I am paying a mortgage and assisting my husband with our mutual debt and repayment of  my old closed accounts which we took out a loan for 2 years ago. This loan is scheduled to be paid off by April 2009. Each month we sit down and pay the bills and we see no progress, other than just keeping current.  We would like to be able to one day help others in need and to do that we need to clear this debt up.  By combining these payments into one, perhaps a bit lower and certainly a lower interest rate, payment we could realize this dream.  I am hoping that someone out there is willing to provide me with the opportunity to continue to realize success and achieve future dreams and to continue the Lending Club cycle of helping others.

At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us. And that is why I am here, so that our company will continue to realize the success which it has had for 25 years.    Please feel free to ask any questions. I will gladly provide any additional details you may require.    Thank you for your consideration.  Borrower added on 05/13/10 > We have recently incorporated a new division of our company in Nevada, to take advantage of the better tax structure, and to be closer to our clients.  This will save us thousands of dollars each year on taxes, and help expand the business. The current business climate is also improving, as the economy and world markets stabilize. All of this is good news for us -- as long as we have capital to take advantage of our growth opportunities. This is the main reason for contacting Lending Club, and seeking this short-term loan. I was recently notified by my Credit Keeper account that as of May 18, 2010, my FICO score is at 750. I thought that members of the Lending Club, who may be interested in investing in this current loan, would like to know that. I hope this demonstrates that even under adverse conditions I am able to keep my business and personal accounts in good order, and that I always maintain my obligations in a timely manner.  Our company has been in business for a long time, and throughout the current economic climate -- and the credit crunch that has made business advancement difficult -- we have still maintained all activities in a professional manner. We are able to continue, and to advance, and -- with the support of the members of the Lending Club -- we will prevail. Thank you for being a part of our future. Here is some additional information about our company, and the work we do.  We are in the marketing research and consulting business. Our main task is to speak with customers, and ask them about their experiences. We ask them what they like, what they don't like -- and why. There are many different aspects to this marketing research, but in a nutshell we provide direct-from-the-customer data, and opinions, which our clients then use to improve service.  As the economy is improving, new areas of potential business are opening in many parts of the US, which also means that our clients are stepping up their marketing research activities.

I've been given a great opportunity to stay with an older family member as a sort of live-in maid/nurse for the next two years (guaranteed--perhaps longer) rent free, so my expenses are extremely low, but the percentage rate on my CC's are extremely high!  One is at almost 35% and one is 18%.  This loan would allow me to consolidate the two into a reasonable monthly payment.  I intend to pay over the minimum monthly balance so I can pay off this loan within two years.  I work in retail but my income is steady, my hours do not change week-to-week.  I work 38 hours a week at $11.00 an hour at a local independent book store.  My job security is high--because of the economic down turn, more people are buying used books--and my boss has mentioned that my services are extremely valuable.  I not only do general retail work for the store, but I am also working on building the company website.  I also attend 6-9 units of community college (for now) every semester.  I receive financial aide, but it's barely enough to cover the expense of tuition and books, not to mention supplies and transportation.

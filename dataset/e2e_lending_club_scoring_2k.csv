I have done this a couple of times already with terrific success.  Over the past several years, I have turned my financial life around penny by penny. I went from having a very low FICO, twice as much debt and several derogatory credit marks due to an isolated personal hardship, to cleaning up everything through perseverance, sacrifice and hard work. I am incredibly proud of myself and confident in my ability to become debt free in just a few more years!  My partner is self-employed and work is slow right now. We are not in trouble yet, but I want to be proactive about tightening up the ship and not spending money where I don't have to. That includes high interest rates on debt.

To say it was very rewarding for the entire family is not doing it justice. <br/>The second event occurred just months later. I was involved in a car accident and was out of work for 6 months. <br/>The third event occurred 1 yr after the accident. I had to have both knees replaced, nothing to do with the car accident, again loosing 5 to 6 months of work because of complications 6 weeks into recoup. <br/>During the second two events I found myself using the credit cards to pay the co-pay for medicine and Dr. visits, food and gas. I was able to pay the minimum each month but then the interest on the cards started to edge up one after the other, I found myself swimming against the tide. A loan will get paid down; credit cards never seem to come down.   <br/>Both my husband and I are good credit risks.  We have never defaulted on our bills.

In the current economy, only the wealthy and the destitute(the only ones who qualify for much financial aid) can afford to go to school using the more traditional payment types. Because I make enough to live on, I don't have the opportunity to better myself without seeking a loan.   My credit history and score are reasonably good, and hopefully will be improving more in the coming years. I always make payments on time, and usually pay more than the minimum, because I don't really like being in debt. Also, the job info. on this site won't really give a good idea of how much I actually make. I recently (January of this year) got a job with the state of CT. In order to accomodate the schedule for it, I dropped myself down to on-call status with my other employer Sunrise Northeast, for whom I've worked for over 5 years. I take extra hours as a I please with both jobs, and therefore make 2-3 times my base pay, which is only about 1200 per month, pretax.

I have had a perfect credit history since January of 2002, including 0 late payments and several different types of accounts (including an installment loan and credit card accounts).<br/><br/>I have been in my present line of work since graduation - 4 consecutive years, moving from an income of ~$35,000 to more than twice that in a short time. I am in the extremely stable healthcare field, and they are hiring even more people of my title at the facility I work with because the demand for our services has grown exponentially in the last 3 years.<br/><br/>I plan to use the funds to consolidate remaining veterinary bills (canine - 2 surgeries, including an enterotomy with complications) from higher-rate credit cards to this low rate. I plan to pay the loan back well ahead of time, but the reason I don't pay the debt off directly from my bank account is that I would like to maintain a substantial savings for a potential car / house purchase in the next 12-18 months. Also, I believe this installment loan will continue to raise my credit score, giving me the most favorable terms on my eventual house / car loan(s). My monthly budget is approximately $1,500, as compared to an income of ~$5,000 (net).<br/><br/>After doing the math, this loan saves me slightly more money and allows me to keep a substantial savings account than continuing to pay the debt from higher-interest credit cards.<br/>",medical,Veterinary Expense,288xx,NC,3.5,0,3/1/96,0,,109,10,1,2741,11.6,18,f,1,0,H

I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a pay it forward philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcí¢ŒóŒ_ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, í¢ŒóŒìStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africaí¢ŒóŒ_, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>",small_business,Urban Transportation,750xx,TX,8.04,0,11/1/05,1,,,7,0,14729,85.6,8,f,1,1,H

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.  I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with yoy.",debt_consolidation,Personal Loan to Consolidate Debt,921xx,CA,10.14,1,7/1/95,1,22,,9,0,3608,37.6,20,f,1,0,H

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance. Now many of the promotional APR offers have expired on those cards and the rates have gone way up.     1. Bank of America American Express - $8,272 @ 10%    2. Chase Visa - $2,550 @ 19%    3.

A customer will only wait so long to be serviced. * Need a couple of new computers for new employees. * Would like to open a new location within the next 6 months.

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

After the initial advertising campaign, 5% of revenue will be used for advertising.<br/><br/>-Update the companyí¢ŒóŒ»s electronic equipment:  The electronic equipment the company uses can only be described as antiquated.  Paperwork that is currently presented to the prospective customer is hand written hard copy.  I will use 20% of investor supplied funds to purchase a field laptop, portable printer, and necessary software.  The impact on a prospective customer of a hand written proposal vs. a color, graphical electronic printout is well worth the cost.  <br/><br/>-Company Image:  I will use 20% of the investor supplied funds to update the company image.  The company does not have a website so a website will need to be developed and hosted.  Business cards, printed brochures, folders will need to be purchased also.  The company has no uniforms.  Uniforms for the crew and evaluator will give the company a more professional appearance.<br/><br/> The truck the company uses to haul the crew and heavy duty equipment is 14 years old.  It runs well but the appearance leaves much to be desired.  I will have the truck painted.  I will also have the company logo and contact information printed on the truck.  The company trailer will get the same treatment.<br/><br/>-Job materials: 20% of investor supplied funds will be set aside materials that will need to be purchased to complete the first job.<br/><br/>-The remaining investor supplied funds will be used for miscellaneous expenses that will arise during ownership transition such as legal fees.<br/><br/>I do not intend to fundamentally change the way the company does business.  The company has been in business for many years and has had success; they do quality work at a reasonable price.

About a year ago I  hit a low point in my life and was struggling with everything !!!!!! One of the hardest times for me which gave me the final push I needed to make a change was the fact that I ended a very serious six year relationship.

Well not ANYMORE!!!  I vowed to myself to do what  makes me happy and to live my OWN life!!!   	For me, Education and Exploring are my biggest passions!!!!  About four months ago I received the opportunity to move to MIAMI and attend FIU where I have the prospect  to study abroad in Germany!!!!  I jumped on this opportunity of a lifetime and have been saving all the money I have made  over the past four months but I'm about 2000 short of reaching my goal to pay for tuition!! I have already applied for loans and grants and have  received as much as I could from them. I need more help so that's why I came to the Lending Club! I have used this program before and Ií¢ŒóŒ»m currently at great standing with this program. I have never been late on a payment and I'm a trustworthy member.

I have 2 savings accounts and a 401(k) plan that I could easily tap into and pay off all my credit card debt but that would be a last resort.  I want to stay on track with building my emergency funds and retirement savings and at the same time make regular monthly payments against my debt so I can build upon my credit worthiness.<br/><br/>The Numbers:  Currently, my monthly budget allocates $500 towards credit card payments.  The $328 monthly payment on this consolidation loan is set at a lower APR, which enables me to pay off my credit card debt in just 3 years.  At the rate I'm going, it would take at least 7 years to pay them off (longer if they continue to hike up their rates and fees!)

I'm currently an associate at a middle market investment bank making $75,000 per year. I'm looking to obtain a loan to obtain some breathing room and pay off my remaining car loan thereby obtaining the title to sell. Once sold, I plan on leasing an affordable vehicle with a warranty. My current 2002 vehicle is out of warranty and is starting to fall apart, this has the possiblity to become very costly. I'm also looking to pay off my AMEX balance of $3,000. So in essence, trying to obtain money for a debt swap thereby ridding my high interest AMEX debt and ridding myself of my current vehicle liability.

I made the mistake 3 years ago to do a cash transfer, thinking it transferred with the same interest rate of fixed interest rate of 9.9 %, and to my horror the interest was over 21%.

I have talked to B of A numerous times to try to lower that interest rate because of course they pay off the lower interest rates first so the higher interest rate part keeps climbing. I think you will find that I have excellent credit and hope to find a more reasonable rate for my debt. We very rarely use our credit card and only used it recently for a car repair of $1000.00 I applied for a different card recently to see if it would cover the cost, but am reluctant to use it and it doesn't cover enough to take care of the higher interest portion.

The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal you give me money, I say thanks and make payments kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctoräó»s bills and auto repairs from last year. All of that is now resolved and we are paying everything down, and Iäó»ve never missed a payment on anything.",educational,Adopt a math student!,294xx,SC,29.6,0,9/1/03,1,0,0,6,0,3043,58.5,6,f,1,0,H

My current take home is $2,185 (after tax) bi-weekly, so it's around $4,300 per month (after tax.)   I have been with my current employer for 2 years and have continuously been employed for 10 years with no gap.  I can fully document my current income by providing copies of paystubs or W2 to Lending Club.  My current monthly fixed expenses are as follows: Car Payment    $347 Car Insurance  $100 Student Loan     $75 Lending Club    $221 Cell Phone        $ 30 Rent/Utilities   $   0 (Fiance pays for all living expense) Total:                $773  With the above expenses..it leaves me $3,527 a month so I am in a good position to carry this new loan without over-stretching my finance.

My name is Roberto and I am currently a 24-year old medical student at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I am a kind and smart guy that is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon.  In the past (2006) I used Prosper to borrow money to fix up my 1971 Chevrolet Nova Muscle Car and was very pleased with the experience.  I borrowed $3,000 and paid it off in 12 months.  I am now seeking $10,750 to invest in U.S. equities and will be paying off my loan in 36 months.  I am an extremely hard working guy that was top of my class in college.  I am a very low risk borrower as I have NEVER been late on a credit card payment or peer-to-peer lending payment.  I have a lot going for me and will not risk messing up my credit or reputation by being late on any payments to a lender.  I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at http://www.pdsoros.org/current_fellows/   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over $23,000 in cash, all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around $30,000, owe $8000 on my credit cards (that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of $2500/month, I only use $1700 of it, does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score), go to medical school on a near full-ride, and have positive cash flow exceeding $800/month after all my expenses are taken into account.  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor.  Her income will cover groceries, gas, and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over $1100/month starting this fall. I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer.  You may ask why I have $8,000 in credit card debt when I have $23,000 in cash and $30,000 in assets?  That is because I have a 0% APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now.  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring, we have paid for the honeymoon, and our parents are paying for the wedding. I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0% APR deal ends I will pay the cards off.  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this $10,750 loan.   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities.  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing. This enormous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression, has left good companies (in infrastructure, tech, agriculture, shipping) trading at a fraction of what they were.  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every U.S. economic crisis in history.  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of $10,000 and turned it into $20,000 through learning to manage risk with stops, investing on a mixture of momentum, news, technical analysis, and fundamentals, not letting emotion, greed, or fear make me hold losing positions, learning to sell my losses and ride my gains, etc.  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 (2004 BMW 330Ci).  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon (next couple years) has once again convinced me to start to move some money ($5,000) back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already.  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan.",small_business,Stanford MedStudent SeekingInvestment$$,930xx,CA,14.98,0,1/1/00,0,,,9,0,26333,77.2,14,f,1,0,H

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.

By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.

No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.

At the time, my goal was to pay off the cards in 5 years.  I managed to bring it down from 11K from 2 years ago to about 8K today. My debt is around 8500 right now, and paying approximately 400 to 600 per month. Have a handful of credit cards which interest charges ranges from 10% to 24%. My old plan was to pay off the lowest balance card first, which thankfully in my case was the highest interest rate card and work my way through the highest balance eventually.  <br/>Now I realized that it made more sense to consolidate the high interest loans into a single rate, low payment plan especially now that we are expecting our first child. Consolidating the loans would lower our monthly payments as well as allowing us to divert that extra money towards child care costs, and perhaps also towards building our emergency fund which we had greatly neglected for the longest time.<br/>The new plan now is to pay off unsecured debt, build up our emergency fund and hopefully still have extra cash to put into another investment while still living comfortably within our means, especially with the new addition to our family.<br/> Borrower added on 01/28/10 > To answer other potential questions:<br/><br/>Monthly bills: 1820 for mortgage, 370 for HOA, about 150 for cable/internet, 150 for a family cell phone plan, about 145 for school loans (took some additional classes for Accounting certification), about 40 to 100 for electricity (depending on the season). <br/><br/>Credit card balances/interest rates are as follows:<br/>Citi - 4,562.22 @ 14.990<br/>Amex - 2,042.24 @ 15.210<br/>Wells Fargo - 1,918.61 @ 6.65 (just want to pay this balance off already)<br/>*Have other balances on department store cards which I am paying off separately this month, totalling approximately $800.<br/><br/>I have a spouse but we chose to keep our finances (and debt) separate except for the mortgage, HOA, phone bill and property tax.

The original request was for $7500, but since that posting, we have had money come in from an unexpected source, so we are able to drop the amount of the loan.<br/><br/>We now have the rental truck paid for along with our estimated costs for hotel, food, and gas.  What this money would be used for is the associated costs of setting up our new home.  We have an apartment reserved for us, but we need to pay a deposit on it as well as possible deposits on utility services.  We will also need to buy groceries to restock the pantry and refrigerator.  In addition, there will be approximately a 3-week gap between when my paychecks from my old job end and when my first paycheck from my new position arrives.  That last &quot;old&quot; paycheck will pay the rent for the month, but not any of the other living expenses of the month.<br/><br/>Please consider helping us with our situation!

I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.

I am a professional dancer who is undergoing a comprehensive Pilates Certification. I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.  Lindsey co-directs GoGoVertigoat Dance Project (www.gogovertigoat.org).

I would like to furnish my apartment, but i can not get a loan because my credit score is too low.  I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.    I would like to request a loan in the amount of $15,000.  I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.  I am interested in applying for the loan.    Thank you.  Cheareen Jones    ",home_improvement,I WOULD LIKE TO FURNISH MY APARTMENT,071xx,NJ,5.17,1,12/1/95,2,16,0,2,0,1340,53.6,16,f,1,1,H

We're a happily married couple (17 years) with children, and we're seeking a loan to eliminate our credit card debt. For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves on-demand (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.   Thank you!",debt_consolidation,Loan To Eliminate Credit Card Debt,335xx,FL,13.43,0,12/1/91,0,,89,6,1,30497,93.8,14,f,1,1,H

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.

Ií¢ŒóŒ»m currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job Ií¢ŒóŒ»ve done since last December after getting out of school.  Ií¢ŒóŒ»m a hard worker, and Ií¢ŒóŒ»m usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, Ií¢ŒóŒ»ve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that Ií¢ŒóŒ»ve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, Ií¢ŒóŒ»ve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I doní¢ŒóŒ»t have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that Ií¢ŒóŒ»m not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, Ií¢ŒóŒ»ve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, Ií¢ŒóŒ»ll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when Ií¢ŒóŒ»m asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  Ií¢ŒóŒ»m not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until Ií¢ŒóŒ»m in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, Ií¢ŒóŒ»m willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave Ramseyí¢ŒóŒ»s Financial Peace University course.  In case youí¢ŒóŒ»re not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where í¢ŒóŒìevery dollar is spent before the month begins.í¢ŒóŒ_  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.  Thanks for reading, and I look forward to working with you.",small_business,I just need a chance,787xx,TX,10.32,0,6/1/05,1,,,4,0,3688,97.1,6,f,1,0,H

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities.

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan B was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan C is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan C.

It has been a lifelong dream of mine to own a muscle car that I could drive and enjoy the rest of my life. If I am able to get full funding this dream will become more of a reality for me. The reason I am a good borrower is because I care about my credit score and it is more than just a number to me. I strive to make my score as high as possible. Ways I do this is by never missing or being late on any of my payments. A higher credit score gives you the opportunity to have more access in life; to make sure that I get this I always will make my payments and on time. My job is about as stable as a job could be. Meaning there is no possible way of me being laid off or let go. I am pretty high up on the food chain at my job and all my managers see me as their best employee because of my work ethic and willingness to work other co-workers shifts when they are not mine. Additionally, my managers like the overall quality of job I do. I don't just do the job as quick as possible to get it done rather I ensure excellent quality while being as efficient as possible.

Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd. The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food.

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in context for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollaräó»s ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who readäó_ well I wonäó»t digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

I currently own a small 6 employee business in Minnesota, I started the business about 3 years ago and it is really taking off. We currently have over $1,300,000 in inventory and are looking to hire more employees. I would like this loan to buy even more inventory and to simply try out this marketplace.  We invest every single dollar back into the business so even though $7,500 isnt much, if I get it at a low enough interest rate then it is practically free money to play with. Our current sales are about $960,000/yr.    A little info about myself: I am married to a wonderful woman and have a beautiful little girl.

This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.  The motor was under water for about an hour, and though we were able to get it running again, it wasn't completely saved. It appears something got tweaked inside when it got wet while running. This is a large center console fishing boat that is in demand on a daily basis.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I plan to use the money to continue to grow my small business.  I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.  I purchased this business last year, investing a good portion of my life savings as well as some home equity into it.  I have grown the revenue roughly 40% over the previous ownership, and I have become a one-stop-shop for everything fun related in conjunction with watersports.  In 10 months we have added 2 more boats and 2 waverunners, 4 kayaks, 3 surfboards, a banana boat, boogie boards, as well as other revenue generating equipment to the fleet.  I have developed working relationships with Hilton, Marriott, and various other resort companies here in South Florida, and I plan to begin an online reservation system and Franchise plan in the near future.  This extra capital will allow me to stretch a vital purchase out over time in order to not hinder further growth and progress of my small business.
